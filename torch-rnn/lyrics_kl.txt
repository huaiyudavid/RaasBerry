bull's eye that's what we came for

no pain no gain it's embedded in the brain
i'm in it for the grip motherfuck the fame



9th wonder warren g

yeah i'm driver and the shooter and the taxi
i dare you motherfuckers get at me
yeah yeah yeah
i dare you motherfuckers get at me yeah


see i grew up with the blue team before there was a ustream
seen a lot of niggas knocked out over shoe strings
rhyming on these beats since the nineties i'm a factor
here with this career until i'm in the hereafter
classic with this mic like mike when he was blacker
and you you remind me of me when i was wacker
i read lines and bring drama like an actor
but i'm so hollywood that you would think that i'm a rapper
you think i got it backwards it really doesn't matter
producer meets the rapper he's the former i'm the latter
spacing out these bars so you niggas can climb on
i'm proof that you can still make loot and keep your rhymes strong
burn out the industry as hot as my performance
be the mainstream dream meets the nightmare of normalcy
the anti of everything cool
still most likely to succeed cause there ain't no rules yeah


uh my nigga we out chere photo cutlass
another known for your luggage don't trip
you fabricate to the public we don't believe shit believe it or not
call your bluff then leave your ass with knots
the juggernaut is in your rectum call pac and resurrect him
i'm sure to cause a spectrum especially when my mental telepathy
start to f 'em aka fuck 'em
aka nothing's in my way once i start b b bucking fuck up your function
and your house party my life surely about fortune and vice
if the feds caught me i tread softly judge toss me life
and your high tops and my posse came to properly fight
everyone's watching alright if you're not watching me lie
still my big cousin a kite
got my shit buzzing when shit wasn't a doorbell an insect or a light year in sight
amen now won't you be a man and pay respects
enjoy as we progress destroy your baby steps
son 
uhh; feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
tell my a$ap killers get they pistols ready 
send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
don't be scared nigga is you ready
i've been thinkin' 'bout all the o's in my bank account 
x the o's/hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
ever since this new star fame came about
or ever since me and drizzy started hangin' out 
young boy let his gun bang let his nuts hang
transition to a lamborghini from a mustang
drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 anything is better than that 1 train
bag made of goyard cheffin' like i'm boyar 
dee probably sellin' d in your local courtyard
braids like i'm o dog my la familia go hard
down to my inlaws they outlaws with no laws


we outlawed then i bogart any pros that got 'proached at
with a toe tag get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
i roll past and i blaze y'all like "doo doo" i hate y'all
when the beef cooked i ate y'all like "mmm mmm"
let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold; i rhyme cold
my k hot your 9 cold that bark like k 9 drone
that ba nana clip straight from the rip
i'll make that shirt say rip   i'm on some shit
if i'm not the hottest then hell must've froze over
you thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
i carry traits of a traumatized soldier
don't look in my face i might snap i might choke ya
spine right out of place give me dap like you 'posed ta
darts at your posters dark nights like this
i metamorph like i'm 'posed ta i might slice my wrist
or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff


barely even conscious talkin' to my conscience
gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
i'm on my convict don't drop bars i drop prisons
don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
somehow bypassed the bias and the  isms
the violence and the killin' so given
they seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'nance
unfortunately i am not that type of niglet
but pass the pot let me skillet
just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with jigga
and i'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the roc
but my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
and i swear it hurt me soul
i try to prevail but when i preach it only hurt their sales
like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
but you my nigga wish you the best for real


when you mention my name amongst other white rappers
or that matter any fuckin' rapper fuck it
painter skater musician trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
burger flippin' eat sleep shittin' human bein' you would be in
trouble to body double or couple me to these others
cause comparatively speakin' my reach is beyond the bubble
that they put me in my vision's beyond the hubble's
i huddle with nubians new beginnin' again
you in school at 10   late; "radioactive's" goin' gold
and so   great; do i give a flyin' duck
if i'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us
alabama's climbin' up wait no i don't give a flyin' duck~
nothin' but a buckshot 
motherfuck your life pussy blood clot
ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2pac was froze
and thawed out for a spot date at a coachella show yelawolf


weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
and my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
antsy cause i'm high like michael jackson penny loafers
moonwalkin' on the sun barefoot with shades on
bitch pussy smell like a penguin 
wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis 
bitch when i say this i mean this  "ho i'm the meanest" 
dick so big stretch from earth to venus
that molly got me nauseous aw shit no off switch
lawless obnoxious on that "suck my cock" shit
that is my synopsis ostrich posh shit
hoes on some goth shit   stop it you not this
novice regardless heartless and awkward
cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
just bein honest tell me isn't that ironic


swiftly i shift the bimmer 860 
a heavy smoker so you know i brought the blake with me
the moons reflection off the lake hit me
you should've stayed with me now many asian bitches lay with me
the face is silky like a tablecloth 
my shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a chilean horse 
red roses dropped from boxes very often 
confetti torchin' drinking henny like i'm kenny lofton 
outstandin'; i fixed the game 
between georgia southern and grambling; you see us scramblin'
sellin' susan sarandon ; the cloud of smoke like the phantom
damn this shit tastes like fantastic uh
you see me comin' through in each state 
just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake 
cuffed to my wrist ive got the briefcase 
the gavel slam im a free man try not to eat ham yeah


big krit shawty
spit like my last breath: casket rap six deep
eyes closed the black is back out come the 'lac with flats
after that bottles i cant pronounce like how you ask for that
"why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch"
all i had was rap when all they had was wack; all i wanted was love
and all they had was dap; fuck them haters and fuck them hoes a championship win 
is the aftermath ask lebron open palm slap a bitch
walk the plank or break a bank ive been in the business of sinkin' ships
chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
resuscitations cost the label im taxing if you want a hit
clear fuck your career bitch i was born here
been a killer 86er nigga thats my born year
get the fuck from round here thats just my country ways
suckin' on your mommas titty bitchin' while i was choppin' blade
grippin grain fuckin hoes candy paint like everglades
miss me with that rapper chatter 
i put that on my sub how could you ever doubt me
most rappers hopin' the world end so they wont have to drop another album
bb king saw the king in me so why cant you
in order to come up close youll have to dig up cash and elvis too 
muddy water flow dixie rebel past
fuck your louis flag poppin' benji tags on your wifeys ass 
thats out of line but in living color
im more like miya bailey on you rap motherfuckers   a true artist      }

halle berry halle lujah

beast


so everybody put your shades on
poobie came to show love like faizon
every bar that i carve is amaz on
wack niggas can't seem to feel our play on
a lil' spice in my swag call it cajun
often wonder to myself where the day's gone
save some save none at the same time
talk shit take a stand in the same rhyme
paid homage to the struggle that's before mine
never bad handing nothing therefore i grind
outshine most niggas call 'em all suns/sons
steady reaching for the stars but it's only one
rapper your favourite rapper this is no pun
big daddy no kane get the job done
i'm bout to stick the whole game up with no gun
and i'ma show you how the south was won
so check it out


this is the part where we run hip hop
and we don't need props we know we the shit
this is the part where we run hip hop
so get them ends hot
i'm yelling all my real niggas "keep moving"
my real bitches "keep moving"
i promise i'ma "keep moving"
if they don't "we do it"
the best 
i swear to give you nothing less nothing less


uh yeah hot damn here we go again
lyrical manslaughter off you and your mans
i'm on the stage you in the stands
i'm on the road you at the crib just scribbling
your best sentence was doing your bid
i'm through with you kids like brenda
i don't want to have to trash bin ya
when ab enter cats get they raps injured
without no reason they be out the whole season
it sorta becomes a cycle like hoes bleeding
i'm at where you can't come like no semen
no homo just admire the power
i'm so visual give you an eiffel like tower
huh but you can never see me
black tear compliment my black lips in the lamborghini
puffing a spliff big as a branch
after i spit it niggas be swimming to get to land damn




jay rock got flows
i'm killing 'em slow like cigarette smoke
running hip hop like 'pac in his prime
i spit murder every bar is a crime
look i do it big like bi
nigga i'm the shit i've doing this since knee high
no i'm not tip but i stay on my ti
these fake ass rappers steady acting like devise
i'ma live and die in cali
what's beef chew through that like rallies
got hoes work 'em out like ballies
do shows flip dough like patties
i ain't just rapping i can make it happen
put your whole goddamn career in a casket
lyrical homicide when i write
no bullshit i'm mike with the mic




never pledge allegiance god given flow
i can out preach a deacon once the words get to speaking
give me a reason why i'm not the best breathing
they worship the ground i walk on though i'm harder than cement
sticking to the streets like convertible oil leaks
portable handgun who want to test
i can pass out many scantrons fail many students
tryna play the truest dumber than three stooges
hummers we steady cruising like time do
higher than a vanilla sky float by you
when i'm through i'll probably let you take it back
like my old prom suit that i wore with the tag
rap giant get you little locality smashed
money in a bag stones be yellow as a cat
i like bitches with fat booties but never half ass
when i'm working for certain i'm hurting the game

i said i'm hurting her
pooh i couldn't help it nigga
i had to put a verse this muh'fucker
this shit classic nigga
feel this uh for hip hop for hip hop
for real hip hop hip hop hip hop
fair warning people would have never had a problem
if the naysayers or the doubters would have got him
slumped if the corner for sure i'm a goner
shoot with no aim so them niggas couldn't spot him
now i got a question if i really even want it
when this shit is like a trip through the city of sodom
gomorrah the horror stories are endless
workshop working all night no apprentice
funny when a nigga speak truth he a menace
ushered in the underground lifelong sentence
there's where i dwell ain't no need to cry for me
rapper gonna eat and i eat well
it's been six years since i stepped out the shell
talent on the rise to the top i propel
big dho set sail your boy gon' win
bet niggas act crazy when they see us again
i'm really going in i've been had nothing to lose
so i choose to take y'all through a spin
a journey through the mind of a sane ass artist
if you spitting blah blah shit you a target
if you spitting blah blah shit then just forfeit
what go around come around now they all on my dick


kendrick lamar i'm bout to get my mop stick
niggas bump their gums and their bitches be bumping my shit
i fry your optics if you watching my style watch it
tyrannosaurus reading a thesaurus hold rappers hostage
catastrophic it's 9 11 when i'm repping
skip college to fly first class learn a lesson
straight brutal roman numerals
number one eating ramen noodles rhyming crucial under the sun
kudos to the most high which is me
i probably make 'em plan their suicide so usually
i ain't never been with the shit starting but y'all done started some shit
i'm bout to drink some ex lax then commence
to returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
calm down you more like trina than trinidad at spots now
throw your dubs up
pussy probably holding daisy dukes and c cups
i look inside this industry and i don't see much
i just see lunch and your shit that's more bore like tourists
i'm laid back got feet up how cool is that
the twenty ten kool g rap whenever i rap
i got my arsenal stuck on my back i'm ready for war
they tend to look for me when they fiend for afeni shakur
conversing not hibernating under the planet core
at thirteen i cancelled pg 13 and went for gore
that's what i pledge
it's profound that i'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds


yeah  they saying he a breath of fresh air 
they can't smell all this weed that i brought in here
black & mild smoke still linger on my clothes
so unprofessional i shouldn't be meeting with millionaires
pull up a chair i'll school you to it
i was a student truant that never studied just always knew it
you just new to it with no clue on how you should do it
like youth in junior high school when puberty's looming
and mind you i never mined you i ain't digging for gold
honestly i just want to stick my dick in some hoes
kick a flow hit the 'dro with my bros
tippy toe in this rap game make a lil' name
with this lil' lane i've been paving since i was a teen
that i never really thought that i would attain
when big pooh dropped 'sleepers' i could barely get a feature
they ain't know this regular nigga would be the future
i've viewed the roof from the floor i've been here before
i'm finna blow a couple of times over like two tubas
and i'ma still want more with this appetite
till the critics stop giving me mixed signals like traffic lights
you know the lavish life but for now i'm the new kunta
slave to my rhyme book a line of mine your time's up
the bastard kissing your bitch with the blackened suit coolers
she'll testify excuse judas when i'm crucified
as i look up to the sky
thought about a 100 things to do before i die
hit all the girls i want and make sure my niggaz right
and my family live that life
as i look up to the sky
thought about a 100 things to do before i die
wonderin if i could live it all in one life
cause it could all end in one night
as i look up to the sky
i thought about a 100 things to do before i die


couple niggaz on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
same shit different nights till i live a different life
sean you looking tired damn homie that's all
i've been stressin so hard i'm surprised i ain't going bald
haters praying i fall move back in with my moms
take online classes and turn back into ya'll hatin'
i guess they want your lights out when you the plug
niggaz wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
from where they move the drugs buddha love
niggaz sleepin with that mac and i ain't talkin bout computer love
all the wrong people you a price tag
now you pray to god hoping that you got a christ tag
make it where i'm from stay who i become
time to raise hell say nay my son
taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
and have the fam there too




if i just stop breathin even though i got all this motherfuckin money
won't keep my heart beatin
just don't let me die
wake me up
you can't catch me dreamin
bout all of this motherfuckin money
cocaine rush i'm speedin
cocaine rush


i'm just a detroit nigga nothing extra about me
i go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
i strive for perfection at the same time
i'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me
shit i'm just waiting on a win
come up with better hooks the hoes'll take it on the chin
we are 6 mile bred thats why you see our sick style yeah
crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
momma happy at me daddy happy at me
the baddest chick is yonking imagine this chatty yapping at me
5 years ago i was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
now i'm cali swaggin'
my nigga listen i'm over the fame
you number 1 i'm 23 my mission is take over the game
you rollin with lames we ain't rollin the same
i'm the best out in this motherfucker
if i could get a check out of this motherfucka big enough to set my kids up for life
i could check out of this motherfucka with no regrets
if you ain't living your life for ya kids i ain't giving yo ass no respect


  


i gotta break ya fuckin heart
i gotta climb these fuckin charts 
i gotta do something that's innovative
creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
i gotta spend one summer in tijuana with tia and tia's momma
breakfast in bed is head with plenty of carne asada 
i gotta find me a wife to elope 
i got a fine cause i ain't wanna vote i promise
i know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
but those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
i can easily pretend like yall but thats not me
i gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
need to know every detail about this earth the devil controls it
so before you scrutinise how i feel ask god if those polls important
the end is near

  
hm mm i look up

from the city where every month is mayday at home spray your dome
niggas get sprayed up like ak was cologne for a paycheck or loan
yeah i know that shit ain't fair
they say detroit ain't got a chance we ain't even got a mayor
you write your name with a sharpie i write mine in stone
i knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
we on tryna be better than err'body that's better than err'body
rep detroit err'body detroit versus err'body
i'm so fuckin' first class i could spit up on every pilot
the city's my metropolis feel it it's metabolic
and i'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
i'm one of the hottest because i flame drop drop fire
and not because i'm name dropping "hall of fame" droppin'
and i ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're og's
cause that ain't the way of a og
so i g o collect more g's every dollar
never changed though i'm just the new version of old me
forever hot headed but never got cold feet
got up in the game won't look back at my old seats
clique so deep we take up the whole street
i need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week sean don


miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
peddlin' sin thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
i'm not gonna fold or demise

i'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
i'm important like the pope i'm a muslim on pork
i'm makaveli's offspring i'm the king of new york
king of the coast one hand i juggle them both
the juggernaut's all in your jugular you take me for jokes
live in the basement church pews and funeral faces
cartier bracelets for my women friends i'm in vegas
who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be
if phil jackson came back still no coachin' me
i'm uncoachable i'm unsociable fuck y'all clubs
fuck y'all pictures your instagram can gobble these nuts
gobble dick up til you hiccup my big homie kurupt
this the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch 

i've seen niggas transform like villain decepticons
mollies'll prolly turn these niggas to fucking lindsay lohan
a bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
playing with barbies wreck the porsche before you give them the car key
judgment to the monarchy blessings to paul mccartney
you called me a black beatle i'm either that or a marley

i'm dressed in all black this is not for the fan of elvis
i'm aiming straight for your pelvis you can't stomach me
you plan on stumpin' me bitch ive been jumped before you put a gun on me
bitch i put one on yours i'm sean connery
james bonding with none of you niggas climbin' 100 mil' in front of me
and i'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
and if you're in it better run for pete's sake
i heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
bout who's the best mc kendrick jigga and nas
eminem andre 3000 the rest of y'all
new niggas just new niggas don't get involved
and i ain't rocking no more designer shit
white ts and nike cortez this red corvettes anonymous

and that goes for jermaine cole big krit wale
pusha t meek millz a$ap rocky drake
big sean jay electron' tyler mac miller
i got love for you all but i'm tryna murder you niggas
trying to make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
they don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
what is competition i'm trying to raise the bar high
who tryna jump and get it you're better off trying to skydive
out the exit window of 5 g5s with 5 grand
with your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck trying land
with the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
bumpin pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
is an option of violence someone heard the stewardess said
that your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
west coast


you could check my name on the books
i earth wind and fired the verse then rained on the hook
the legend of dorothy flowers proclaimed from the roof
the tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
of the wild magnolia mother of many soldiers
we live by every single word she ever told us
watch over your shoulders and keep a tin of beans 
for when the weather turns the coldest; the lord is our shepherd
so our cup runneth over; put your trust in the lord 
but tether your chevy nova; im spittin' this shit for closure
and god is my witness so you could get it from hova
to all you magicians thats fidgeting with the cobra
im silent as a rock cause i came from a rock
thats why i came with the rock then signed my name on the roc
draw a line around some earth then put my name on the plot
cause i endured a lot of pain for everything that i got
the eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart
and the tissue is like an angel kissin you in the dark
you go from blind sight to hindsight passion of the christ
right to baskin' in the limelight it take time to get your mind right
jay electricity pbs mysteries
in a lofty place tangling with satan over history
you cant say shit to me   alhamdulillah
its strictly by faith that we made it this far
yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
a day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
a week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
two weeks before that couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
a month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
and this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
i shook my head turned around then found a hundred dollars

 *2x*
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why i don't know why i don't know why


yesterday i invaded privacy of a home
the day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
a week before i had loaded bullets inside that chrome
two weeks before that i shot them bullets and he was gone
a month before that i cursed my mother then slammed the door
six months before that i hit my woman she hit the floor
i stormed out then seen a black honda accord
them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy

 *2x*


so today i laid in my bed stared at the ceiling
closed my eyes then asked myself how i was feeling
i analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
is my life coincidental or just god willing
i came to grips jumped up looked out the window
seen my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
bullets is nameless i guess this was meant for
me to give him a hundred dollars then trash my pistol


now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why now i know why now i know why

lord help me cause i need you

but it's all to soothe the pain from this cold cold world
sometimes i think you can help me 
but this bus here is temporary so i'm talking to you
this sick world will drive a sane man crazy
 daughters having their father's babies
and this the news i hear
when i got kids nieces and nephews turn a year
i wonder will it get better
a little cheddar when it get better
but the rest of that's cash
make last year's christmas gift be my bad

 *2x*
but somehow you keep blessing me
but somehow you keep blessing me
but somehow you keep blessing me
but somehow you keep blessing me
but somehow but somehow but somehow


ohhhhhh yeahhhh
somehow you keep blessing me
ohhhh yeah yeah yeah
if i just keep the faith yeah yeah
i know you'll be right there
sometimes it may not seem that you are there
but you're there i feel you're there you're everywhere
and i thank you for protecting me in these streets
from danger seen and unseen
i never know what happened the night i wasn't there
something told me leave so i left
it was the next morning three got shot after the club
all listening to that small voice oh you saved my life
"kids is what make me feel so good
 see you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
 see the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
 after i done passed down the hill"

"young and black"


don't you know that's it's true
that for me and for you
the world is a ghetto
don't you know don't you know that's it's true
that for me and for you
the world is a ghetto


"then there's a lot of funky things in this country
 and there's good things too
 but our rights are more funky than you good
 shit ain't getting better"

"we've changed some for the best
 an awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"


walking down the street foggy eyed
looking at the sky starry eyed
searching for a place weary eyes
crying in the night yeah yeah teary eyed




"dude we got to get our minds together"

"any time a brother was shot by another brother in his own neighborhood
 then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket they need to have the police down there
 cause see the niggas is naacp and
 niggas ain't acting like colored people"

"if i can't work and make it i steal and take it"

" if a nigga can put air in a bottle and sell it he'll do it man
 a nigga can sell anything i ain't gon' lie"


as i watched the sky change colors
the rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
the black mothers are stressing the coroners have covered
another statistic episodes of a cold summer
the street runners got the same legs as michael johnson
the fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
profanity in the air the children use the content
the vanity's in the air that louis bag haunted
that black girl with the hair that's kind of coarse
her baby daddy's in court she smoking on a newport
seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
or becoming an aids victim while touching them zippers
the life that we living in things we would do just to live again
how can an angel forever live in sin




"you know well anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimping"

"okay well i'ma tell you what soul brother lookie here
 can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self you understand"

"then there's a lot of funky things in this country
 and there's good things too
 but our rights are more funky than you good
 shit ain't getting better"

"we've changed some for the best
 an awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high


uh yeah yo started at the surface and my goal is up
cause once you stay down then you gon' get stuck
and i'm just tryna climb and grind at the same time
dangling off rooftops is what i call hang time
walking through the hall counting my flaws
my ego got caught in an elevator wall
got it out raised it to the rooftop damn
got to take the ladder cause the escalator jammed
made it to the top but i ain't even stopping
i said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
i'm gone to the skies i'm nothing more than another rebel
but i'm still tryna take it to another level
get up out the ghetto maybe hop up on a shuttle
eating jello with a piece of metal my foot on the pedal
if people say the world could fit into a little pebble
then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
let's get it off




look inside my eyes you can see the universe fly
deep inside my pupils the alien's camouflaged
another way to shoot you my mind is of mass destruction
i drop a gallon of henny in the big dipper then dive
bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
ever seen a martian gorgeous or some ufo porsches
i live inside the air plus i wear air jordans
so the mic/mike is always near me whether swagging or recording
journey on my voyage you know that sky is the limit
but it's ironic that method never applied to kendrick
i catapult over your telescope and when i'm finished
i grab the fire that's burning from mars to light an incense
this rapping's just a metaphor and i deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor about ambition
i envision me taking off astronauting myself
fuck the world i'll beat that bitch with the orion's belt
that's high




as i'm floating all alone i look up and i start thinking
in a moment i'll be gone getting high so i'm not sinking
as i'm floating all alone i look up and i start thinking
in a moment i'll be gone getting high so i'm not sinking
yeah yeahyeah
getting high so i'm not sinking yeah

suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals

poked her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
rollin' up them vegetables rappin' with that special flow
only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with c4

employer tryna write me up but now i'm a writer
with ambitions of a rider and half the shit on my rider i don't even want
the fanta's for us the henny's for the sluts 
givenchy bikers with the rev rips
balmain badmon bathing ape on my dick 
paid by the bloods raised by the crips
soulo hoe the prophecies atrocities exhibition 
oh yeah now a nigga livin' good
but good could be better i wish a motherfucker would
 soul~




life is like an appetite of truth and dare i double dare ya
life to end in vain before the end is near see i can hear ya

takin' off to abu dhabi beamin' up the motor scotty

late nights mixed with early days 
it'll probably be that way until the pearly gates 
stress weighin' on me they want me to nervous break
these hoes showin' fake love when i prefer the hate man
sheesh at least if you real then i have to respect it 
realize the energy you give is what you manifested 
so understand we positive as could be
the vision is still intact the show is fresh out of seats
boy it's never goin' south 'less we down in south beach
khaled on the jet skiis preachin' what you believe in

now or later either way i'ma take it just like it's fuckin' taxes
no wonder i'm on fire i done been to hell and back bitch
lately i been livin' life in detachment
i practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
we been all in the hollywood hills and never been actin'
detroit gave me an accent and christ gave me his passion
father help us police doin' target practice with real bodies
mommas in the streets cryin' standin' over a still body 
niggas over stressin' we under investigation
every day off to the races can't fuck with you if you racist 
beat your ass until you purple they can't even tell what your race is 
dr king meet dr dre except this doctor lost all his patience 
have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facin' adjacent
until you deposit payment or reparations
if you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
it feel like i'm finally free and unlocked my spirit with the holy key


  
and i'ma celebrate it for a looong time
the drama couldn't break me now it's allll mine
surrounded by my angels and we allll shine
holy holy holy 


everything i touch may disintegrate into dust 
everything i trust may dishonor me in disgust 
everything is everything affidavits and wedding rings
out for blood on my higher horse i report what it was
i don't wear crosses no more yeshua's comin' back
i ain't scared of losses no more i see life in that
i don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
the universe and the heavens work in my dna
kendrick said "fuck mother earth" that's psa
the land of the wicked the foundation of lucifer's spirit
walkin' zombies and spellcatchers i pray for forgiveness
uncle bobby and paul june is lost again
the underworld and the fourth dimension my family's in
the big money the fast cars my life produced
the blocks i connected while re buildin' this rubix cube
so what you look up to fame and fortune bitches porsches sources with designer thing
brand endorsement joinin' forces with sorcerers signin' me
law enforcement their forces tortures us with violent speed
fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
who knew royce's with choices of color my desire need
crab and oyster with gorgeous abortions i require thee
flesh and poison the point is the reason you won't die in peace
open door for my boy now they eatin' we say finally
i destroy and divorce what you eatin' don't you hire me
tape recordin' my voices and tweak it let's play hide and seek
war distortion and forfeit this evenin' you should try at least
i'm restorin' the portrait of feastin' nigga i am beast
i don't like to sleep i'm up like coyote i might od
hair like odb i'm off a higher need
khaled is valid i been lookin' for inspiration
but when you the only king you the only one in the matrix


ohhhhhh ohh whoooa yeah

we act like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
i'm in a matter of man arm wrestling
hands i was dealt when i said the music business
was all i needed when i got it i was greeted by an alien 
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna has a lady friend
my vice is similar women love when you're my type
and you're winnin from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel
sin city devil in a dress platinum chanel
live the ambiance all cause the audience one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse bein read 
i'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch "yo' ass too fat capitalize that"
and your weave look good with the indian tracks
trackin device on your used 5 series
i don't call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say we're in the area
cruisin in toronto hit me on the cellular
thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks located where you can't see us
a white waitress on stand by when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up jeep no doors
all that nigga was missin was aaliyah
felt like the initiation
a reality livin in the matrix
we talked casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin
then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo
the reason why i'm breathin on the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend say she love more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight 
was when he said you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy full of fame
and bury yourself alive then i died
where you at where you from
what you doin over here motherfucker
what you think what you bang bang
this ain't no motherfuckin game


now i ain't never been no gangsta but i know niggaz know niggaz

aye where they get they greats from 
somethin's burnin i can't figure out what 
it's either lust or a cloud of dust judgment is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of
 but i'm in somethin i don't know how to get outta
left my girl in the house alone is that my soon to be spouse's moan
and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to   busta bust her
the thought's scary yo though and it hurts brace
hope it ain't "here we go yo" cause my head already goes to worst case
scenario though in the first place
 but you confirmed my low end theory though
should've known when i made it all the way to 3rd bass
and that was only the first date could've made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face   first
"no  you don't  under  stand 
i  don't  do this for  anyone  ever" 
yeah that ain't what they all say i'll say
you can suck a softball through a straw used to be my fiancée
'til you sucked on wayne andré and kanye
lebron akon jay lil jon raekwon ma$e
polow da don dre dante ross james conway kwame
guess i'm gettin my g goddang jigga on eh
cause your name i'm beyon' sayin
but fuck it i'm movin on you women are all cra'y
but i'll probably always keep on playin the


"game of love  love "
"la la la la la love"


she doesn't love me no she don't love me no more
she hates my company guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before
and i told her

and i told her



i told that bitch   i'm a sucker for love you a sucker for dick
suckin dick in your momma tub then your granny walked in
told the stupid nigga to duck under the water he drowned like an abortion
they booked you for manslaughter   you beat the case and i called ya
 "sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
and kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
expensive heels you little fuckin ferris wheel
fuckin spinnin on me fuck you think we're gon' get married still
fuckin mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
fairy godmomma better tell you how i fuckin feel
like you should fuckin beat it or fuckin eat it while i'm on my period
now have a blessed day~"  bitch you serious
i'm in the mirror with this look on my face curious
why you ain't fuckin with me you cut me deep as cesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin him
his mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin cordial yeah i got some home trainin
that ain't what you like ain't it what about if i was famous
as marshall would you give fellatio in the carpool
cops pull us over they just wanna know if you gargle
singin   "i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasin her"
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'ma live with the






so needless to say i'm feelin betrayed snatch my house key off her keychain
she jumps off wee bey from "the wire"'s dick now she's chasin me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliché it's all my fault anyway
she's turnin the tables i'm a beat break
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of attack beha 
 vior back together but forgot today was her b day
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstandin but just as i went to slam on the brakes
that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin brake line stepped on them fuckers eight times still goin 73 thank
god there's an exit comin up what the mother f u c k's
wrong with her hit the off ramp 'til i coasted
to a gosh damn halt hit a fuckin tree now
here she comes at full speed she's racin at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
snatch the bitch out her car through the window she's screamin
i body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
and created a sinkhole buried the stink hoe in it then paid to have the street re paved
 woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though cause she's layin next to me in bed
directly aimin a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up like "fuck it i've had it"
i'm checkin into rehab i confess i'm a static addict
i guess that's why i'm so clingy every girl i've ever had 
either says i got too much baggage or i'm too fuckin dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter i'm just a fuckin romantic
i fuckin love you you fuckin bitch combative possessive
in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said "hit the road" then after she left i sent that bitch a text
that said "be careful drivin don't read this and have a accident" she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes
never been a more compelling case than the model covered in l'oréal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape
'til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser/horser than tori spelling's face
still they swarm the gates
of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
'less you're andrea yates don't ask me for a date though you're late
well the sentiment's great   but wait think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood it's mainly cause of the game of
 wait "dinner at 8"
i have infinite hate in my blood it's mainly cause of the



i can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
life and death is no mystery and i wanna taste it
step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity animosity
high philosophy hyper prophesied meditation
reminisce on my wonder years and i wonder here
sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
the sentiment of my nerves that i just persevere
the big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
they say that heaven's real
analyze my demise i say i'm super anxious
recognize i deprive this fear and then embrace it
vandalizin' these walls only if they could talk
conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
lookin' down on my soul now tell me i'm in control now
tell me i can live long and i can live wrong and i can live right
and i can sing song and i can unite with you that i love
you that i like look at my life and tell me i fight
this that final destination this that find some information
this that find some inspiration this that crack the instillation
this that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
please don't bomb my nation embalming fluid waiting
i got mind control when i'm here you goin' hate me when i'm gone
ain't no blood pumpin' no fear i got hope inside of my bones
this that life beyond your own life this ain't physical for mankind
this that out of body experience no coincidence you been died
bitch you're dead




say you will never ever catch me no no no
say you will never ever catch me no no no
say you will never ever catch me no no no
say you will never ever catch me no no no
say you will never ever catch me
say you will never ever catch me

mask on fuck it mask off
mask on fuck it mask off
mask on fuck it mask off
gas gone never nod off
 
i done been through things in my life
feels like too much
i could have broke down and lost my mind
but i'm too strong


i remember being young growing up we didn't have much
going to school with no money eating bagged lunch
speaking of food inside my cupboards it was sad but
knowing inside my mother never would abandon
us and a sob was like the only thing i ever made
really inside i'm trying hard not to cuss and scream
wasn't a dream i was surrounded by a couple fiends
imagine the team stuck in the middle of amphetamines
tryna survive the cliche yeah by any means
using the wit to get some milk and the rice and beans
using the money that wasn't green it was bag brown
ebt it was in me but i was damn proud
people was looking down like i was on the first floor
like i'm looking for charity i ain't begging i'm just poor
plenty and many times i can break and just lose my mind
but i'm strong and i carry on i will never let it define me




life's been hard i'm working the garden more like a fight in the dark
and need to eat but we starving and the lights would go off
i tried to keep it a secret these things are eating at me
no being leave it to beaver you see it's tweedlee dee
eager to breathe the heart is beating too fast
and hard to think what i'm seeing when pops is beating my ass
though it made me a man on both feet i'm an ox
staying true to the plan to always do what i love
could have gave up and ran it would be never enough
and being less of a man but damn we right on the cusp
life in the gutter feels like a knife in the gut
and living righteous and brighter so know we rising above
to judge a book by its cover would your biggest mistake
i realize like no other i do believe in my fate
bad dreams best believe they gon' fade
and better days are coming my way




good kid mad city thirty niggas thirty semi's
plenty blunts plenty remy out the bottle till it's empty
full throttle fast life dale earnhardt sent me
hope i don't crash when i speed past god forgive me
i can see my tribulations getting worse
conversations with my past demons can i soul search
hoping i can find something so defiant i can put a rose on it
smelling death around the corner don't you put your nose on it
wake up on cold mornings thinking bout my life in general
career criminal picture that like a centrefold
only the best of sinners know
how it hurts when you looking to be a saint but the way that you think is pitiful
times is harder where's your father
you never had one he never did bother
and so your passion is a permanent author
telling stories from the streets don't let it shorten your sleep
be strong

just can't find it like a dozen people
catch that vibe at night and bobby whitney
get too tired to write and died in prison

ohh sometimes i get so ahead of myself
feel like i'm   runnin' in circles
ohh and i'm just holdin' onto my breath
i need a   smoke just to exhale
ohh and i get so ahead of myself
but i'll   make it out somehow
so roll another one roll another one
and put it   all in the air now
 

how many souls do you touch a day
how many hoes do you fuck a day
how many flows do your thought convey
how many know you can't walk away
dependin' on the way i feel i might kill everybody around me
might heal everybody around me how the wind blow
open your window at the debris and never let me in
i kick back with kick though
maybe if i could live a hundred years that be real
pay me if i'ma be rhymin' these homonyms

but now he got one i'm ridin' shotgun
with a three piece chicken dinner and shotgun

i made enough residuals to hide some
i gave enough my niggas know i divide some
i told zay i'm the best rapper since twenty five
been like that for a while now i'm twenty nine
any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar~
pardon me see my alter ego was gemini

spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
i proceed my last check in proceeds
to all the kids the hood the bricks the books
to fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
the word to give the life we live as i get
 
   minus first four words
 
  
oh you got two xannies oh just don't forget me

grew with apollonia  rob was makin' chicken
beat me down you beat me down reorganize my face

they say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
thoughts was always cheap cheap cheap but now let's talk 'bout me me me

uh i'm more spiritual than lyrical i'm similar to eli
why cause i'm wearin' black shades and i'm headed west with the word of god 
yeah i think i'm finally ready to talk about it
these niggas just talk about it homie don't play me for no fool
poppin' bottles like in enemigos los dios mio i'm so cold
get so deep in that water water they should call my johnson a harpoon

hm; damn near 30 still set trippin' cuz where you're from i'ma see about it

got one crib worth two cribs and my front lawn yeah that's water fountain
you be talkin' boss sayin' big words like philosophies man you weird homie
what it sounds to me that you broke as fuck and your bitch gon' leave and that's real homie


look inside the eyes of a broke nigga see the stress on his face
look at his heart ain't no love in the place
what's on his mind murder money and mayhem
if he don't see a dollar somebody visiting satan
he grabbed his gat from under the mattress he cocked it back
then grabbed his gloves and a mask then threw on his hat
looked in the mirror and said times is hard
so hard that he got gray hair on his balls pause
in the ghetto you destined to fall
that's why it's a must that we ball
that's why he on the corner lurking waiting for a motherfucker to slip
soon as he see the chance he taking a risk
what should you do when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
empty out your pockets then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist
nothing cause when the gat in your mouth so speechless
any false move then your brain's on the cement
it gets gutter when niggas starving
niggas will run inside your house kill you on target heartless
this is way beyond a cold thriller
this the diary of a broke nigga

  
"pump pump" everybody lay down on the ground
give me whatever you got right now
"pump pump" everybody lay down on the floor
give me whatever you got plus more

"pump pump" make sure you hide your goods when i come mister
you're dealing with the diary of a broke nigga


it's been a whole month he still ain't seen no paper
nigga losing weight every time that he wake up
plus he tired of asking niggas for favors
cause when they get mad they throw it back in his face
that's foul flagrant this nigga been slaving
in the spot all week still ain't seen no paper
that's fucked up they say don't bite the hand that feeds you
but if that hand don't feed you where would that leave you
now that the stress come can't turn back the hands of time
got him thinking back on what he should have done
first thing on his mind now get a gun
shit you gotta eat and you got a son
and a daughter now that's two mouths to feed
and that money seem far like miles to reach
but it's right there but his brain cloudy
life on the wrong road can't reroute it
caught that nigga then showed him what that heater do
if you don't feed your wolves your wolves eat you
this is way beyond a cold thriller
this the diary of a broke nigga


yeah los angeles 'welcome to the terrordome'
city of satan angels can't even get along
no lie my town covered in darkness
hoping that the sun just shine on us
rolling up the kush now i'm letting my mind wander
into another place i ain't tryna go down under
life is like a race and we all tryna finish it
shit never fair strays hitting the innocent
the good die young where i'm from and it's sad to say
that somebody gotta die today
tomorrow's never promised but we living for the moment
nigga time never stops it just keeps on going
crackers just gave my young nigga four life sentences
twenty five times four nigga do the math
and the hood never have witnesses
cause if we did then them shots gon' blast


as i reflect i start realising i wanna
make a way one day for me and my momma family and friends
this ain't the way my life bout to end
so i'm quick to grab on my pen and
give 'em something my people sure to feel
give 'em something that i know is all the way real


just waking up mind playing tricks on me
got the fifth on me gotta take a risk homie
was a ball player till the coach pissed on me
keep it real i could take you down the list homie
be a tradition see these chucks be a mission
burner be the fuel to the flame the key to the ignition
if you banging be serious
boys run up in your pad point blank period moms ain't hearing it
niggas said cuz  got blasted
oh well give a shit shouldn't half assed it
only time you with it when your niggas all tripping
caught your ass slipping now i'm stepping up my crip and steady dipping
riding through the city in lights living it trife
wrong intersection ready to fight
hopping out with my own agenda who the contender
better hope this motherfucker jam 




uh as i'm hearing the first and second verse
i try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
i want to tell rock and q to go to church
but that's a hypocrite because i ain't been in so long
i stare at the world from a righteous point of view
and realise a crisis coming
novocain couldn't numb it the pain is unbearable times two
let's rally a team summon and school the youth
how you feel about it


man i feel the same way as you
it hurts my soul like a needle piercing through the bottom of my shoe
and if you behind bars
hold your head pause
and if you in close range with a nigga with a gun in his waste
i pray the intervention is divine
i got a cousin in jail and handful of homies in heaven
but earlier than expected what the hell


growing up i was a knucklehead
boy you never listen to me that's what my mama said
i'm from the projects i ain't never had shit
me and my older brother we had to share a mattress
no heat no lights had to keep them candles lit
my daddy left me at eight in and out my life and shit
gang bangers dope dealers replaced my father
neighborhood hustlers taught me to get them dollars
that's when i became a problem product of my environment
it's hard to grow up to be a doctor or a fireman
when you constantly seeing that g ride tires screeching
and them shots firing all the time it happens frequently
the hood inspired him to be a g
i bled for the game did it all for the letter b
the big homie gave me the name jay rock
this ain't no rap gimmick this a real life story of watts living nigga


you can take me out the hood
but you can't take the hood out me
and that's the way that it will forever be
and i can't help it i'm gutter
why should i change now
when all my life i've been gang banged out
that project shit run deep in my veins now
and i can't help it
ooh my lord knows that i can't help it


let me take you on a detour east side watts
niggas who go in projects
follow me home to my black and white apartments
police roll through with caution scared to death
the homies got tats across them
capital bh over they necks since birth banging the set
even hoes banging the set
some ain't but most is hood rats they looking for the buck
them trash cans lay in the street ghetto technique for drive bys
for the low them five dollars will get you high
dice games ygs fist fights
six fo's el co's g rides and mini bikes
might see a couple of zombies late night
off what off pipe
membrane dead right no lie
something in the bushes either the ak or the 45 no lie
raised in the ghetto with rats and roaches
smokers on porches getting high off yola
it's colder north but my city's the coldest
where we ain't promised to see the morning nigga




you could take me out the hood but the hood will never leave me
i'm still banging i'm still hanging
the only difference is i'm not slanging nickels and dimes
more like slanging these rap lines
verses of truth when i step in the booth
niggas know i pour my soul for the struggling youth
for that fatherless son who needed love so he ran with a crew
grew up before his older brother did gin and juice
replaced the pain i knew carrying thangs to school
them niggas was tripping i wasn't banging the blue
but they had to respect me i never ran from who
nobody put my faith in god
it's amazing how i overcame them odds
on my momma this past year my life has slightly been revised
but notice i said slightly
cause me being absent from where i came from that's unlikely nigga


motherfucker this is watts california
gangbang murder state

"what's up jay rock" shit just the same old same old
same fiends in the hood chasing the best dope
project hustling chasing them pesos
it's a struggle every day man you know how this shit goes
but my demeanor will never switch cherry red beamer
gangbanged the fuck out red rag around the nina
no doubt i'm living it
been claiming the set since the year they found snoop innocent
slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by timberlands
deport ya asses back where my strap
let me put a hole in 'em
and what's concealed in the black denim will rock 'em to sleep like i babysit 'em
i seen it all loyalty betrayal envy
my close homie died in my arms
twelve hundred project units under the sun
ain't bout where you're at it's about where you're from


welcome to watts california
where we ain't scared to run up on ya
you ain't prepared when it go down
you already dead right about now
welcome to watts california
where we ain't scared to run up on ya
if you're prepared when it go down
then you know it's jay rock turn now


the homie told me put your feelings aside
but since i got signed i been feeling the vibes
niggas play the background and screw they face all day
wanna walk in my shoes wanna take my place
so at any given time they might take my life
so i take the 38 when i ride at night
broad day no exempt niggas kill you when the sun is out
make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house
it's that real you don't feel me yet
fine niggas drop the beat and just let me vent
no mask on fuck around and kill your whole squad
be the last person you see before you meet god
keep the rifle on top of the tripod
aim hard if you live your body might need parts
jay rock putting it down for top dawg
from the bottom to the top we shoot straight to the stars




"the has been another tragic incident

but i'm wiser now showing my young niggas

and you're gonna pay for it


it's a heavy load i stroll on a bumpy road
no jacket when i was cold becomin' one with my soul
stand toe to toe with my foes these wolves in sheep clothes
no weapon on me shall prosper nigga you better watch it
you playin' with fire burnin' you slow hold up
i hear the whispers wishin' it's all cheap voodoo
i keep it cool to keep from goin' cuckoo
with a cal aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
came too far for my feet to fail me
lord if i'm wrong you can help me now hold up

in hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain now listen




i tell 'em all to hail king kendrick resurrectin' my vengeance
been dissectin' your motormouth 'til i break down the engine

take your turn boy
see it's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
see it's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me i never die
my pedigree apparently only to idolize
ahead of me is only my future and idle time
longevity i gotta get used to makin' you mine
you tellin' me i only get used to livin' if fine
you can never live in my shoes permanently paid from god~


when the sun goes down i scream loud i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die my legacy is alive


i die to get it off my chest push words just like weight
i got to eat 'til it shows on my face
tragedy turn to triumph i'm tryin' just to relate
jumpin' off of them towers i'm takin' that leap of faith
playin' at high stakes
now when i speak their pupils they'll dilate through speakers'll vibrate
know you feelin' the vibe that vine couldn't relate
this next clip is long a son of a gun big numbers
do the math now cover the sum
i come from the slums we come for the funds like run it
under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
countin' the ones but truthfully nothin' like hundreds keep it one hundred
roadblock in front of me look i'm runnin' through it
stick and move it sippin' that hennessy this my gutter fluid nothin' to it
what we lost we gon' make it back
like it wasn't missin' now listen you 'bout to pay for that

  
me and my bitch took a little trip
down to the garden took a little dip 
apple juice fallin from her lips
took a little sip  little sip
took a little sip took a little sip
took took a little took a little took a little sip uh
uh huh


aiyyo i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
where niggaz hold tec's like they mad at the ref
that's why i keep a cross on my chest either that or a vest
do you believe that eve had adam in check
and if so you gotta expect
to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
huh cole is the king most definite
my little black book thicker than the old testament
niggaz pay for head but the pussy's sold separate
same bitch givin brains to the minister
the same reason they call mr cee "the finisher"

you deciiide
are we gonna liiive or diiie


so i was takin' a walk the other day
and i seen a woman a blind woman pacin' up and down the sidewalk
she seemed to be a bit frustrated
as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it
so after watchin' her struggle for a while
i decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know 
"hello ma'am can i be of any assistance 
it seems to me that you have lost something
i would like to help you find it"
she replied "oh yes you have lost something
you've lost your life" 

 is it wickedness


"lamar stated his views uhh lamar stated his views
 uhh lamar stated his views uhh lamar stated his views
 uhh lamar stated his views on police brutality
 with that line in the song quote: 
 'and we hate the popo wanna kill us in the street fo' sho''"
"aww please uhh i don't like it"  
it was always me vs the world
until i found it's me vs me
why why why why why why why why




"darling i told you many times
and i am telling you once again
just to remind you sweetheart
that my"


oh lamar
hail mary and marijuana times is hard
pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives i'm a star
life is one funny mu'fucka
a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
i might be buggin' infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable
gun violence crack spot federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well respected calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier
hard times momma on crack a four year old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodgin' policemen workin' for his big homie
small time hustler graduated to a brick on him
$10000 dollars out of a project housin' that's on the daily
seen his first mil' twenty years old had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters   caught a murder case
fingerprints on the gun they assumin' but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird shufflin' anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two tone mustang that 50 thing
they say 5 0 came circlin' parkin' lots and parkin' spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it he brushed them off
and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken see at this chicken spot
there was a light skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth he worked the window
his name was ducky he came from the streets the robert taylor homes
southside projects chiraq the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and $500 dollars
they had a son hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
cadillac seville he'd ride his son around on weekends
three piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before back in '84
that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives tellin' us sellin' us devilish works killin' us crime
intelligent felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
ducky was well aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides; free chicken 
every time anthony posted in line two extra biscuits
anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didn't kill him in fact it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later them same strangers you make 'em meet again
inside recordin' studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
because if anthony killed ducky top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

when i was 27 i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated ten times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money is god playin' a joke on me
is it for the moment and will he see me as job
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before
at 27 my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my momma stressin'
thirty shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
what is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin' drill somethin'
get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
i'm talkin' fear fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear fear of losin' loyalty from pride
cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
i'm talkin' fear fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear whatever it is both is distinctive
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn


goddamn you goddamn me
goddamn us goddamn we
goooddamn us all


verse two says "you only have i known of all the families of the earth
therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities"
so until we come back to these commandments
until you come back to these commandments we're gonna feel this way
we're gonna be under this curse because he said he's gonna punish us
the so called blacks hispanics and native american indians
are the true children of israel
we are the israelites according to the bible
the children of israel he's gonna punish us for our iniquities
for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods 
that are the last as of his son so the lord thy god chasten thee
so just like you chasten your own son
he's gonna chastise you because he loves you
so that's why we get chastised that's why we're in the position that we're in
until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments
and do what the lord said these curses are gonna be upon us
we're gonna be at a lower state in this life 
that we live here in today in united states of america
i love you son and i pray for you
god bless you shalom

fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit internet blogs and pulpit fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin' but nothin' is awkward
the feelin' won't prosper the feelin' is toxic

false prophets schemin' sponsors industry promises

lawsuit visits subpoena served in concert

i can feel it the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it the scream that haunts our logic
i feel like say somethin' i feel like take somethin'
i feel like skatin' off i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for 'em
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em

i need everybody's motherfu 


this that new shit
this that new new shit


wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch don't go to work today
cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make you


wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy   hol' up
wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch don't go to work today
cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
hang with your homies stunt on your baby mama sip some lean
go get a pistol shoot out the window bet your favorite team
play you some madden go to the club or your momma house
whatever you doin' just make it count 
wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money kick your feet up
hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he ain't shit
credit card scam get you a visa make him pay your rent
hop on the 'gram flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
pop you a pill call up your bitches have 'em waitin' on you
go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce
it's whatever just make it count




i wake in the mornin' my head spinnin' from the last night
both in the trance feelings are dead what a fast life
manager called the lobby called it's 11:30
did this before promised myself i'd be a hour early
room full of clothes bag full of money call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry 100k i lost a new chain
hop on the bird hit the next city for another m
take me a nap and do it again
we all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
lookin' for confirmation hopin' election wasn't true
all of us worried all of us buried and our feeling's deep
none of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
still and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor 'bout it
bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passin' things change
revertin' back to our daily programs stuck in our ways
lust


lately i feel like i been lustin' over the fame
lately we lust on the same routine of shame
lately lately lately my lust been hidin' 
lately it's all contradiction   lately i'm not here
lately i lust over self   lust turn into fear
lately in james 4:4 says
"friend of the world is enemy of the lord"
brace yourself lust is all yours


love's gonna get you killed
but pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me and

    
meee i wasn't taught to share but care

meee i wasn't taught to share but care
i care 


hell raisin' wheel chasin' new worldly possessions
flesh makin' spirit breakin' which one would you lessen
the better part the human heart you love 'em or dissect 'em
happiness or flashiness how do you serve the question
see in the perfect world i would be perfect world
i don't trust people enough beyond they surface world
i don't love people enough to put my faith in men
i put my faith in these lyrics hopin' i make amend
i understand i ain't perfect i probably won't come around
this time i might put you down last time i ain't give a fuck i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb you're dealin' with cold thumb
i'm willin' to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
pity parties and functions and you and yours
a perfect world you probably live another 24
i can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
i can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure




maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere


now in a perfect world i probably won't be insensitive
cold as december but never remember what winter did
i wouldn't blame you for mistakes i made or the bed i laid
seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
i know the walls they can listen i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior of you and i
see in a perfect world i'll choose faith over riches
i'll choose work over bitches i'll make schools out of prison
i'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
just to tell 'em we ain't shit but he's been perfect world

i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me lord forgive me   things i don't understand

bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink i got my music i would share it but today i'm yelling
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe


uh look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes i can feel a new life
i always knew life can be dangerous; i can say that i like a challenge 
and you to me is painless you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
fell on my face and awoke with a scar another mistake living deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every making of this tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge even a small lighter can burn a bridge


i can feel the changes i can feel the new people around me 
just want to be famous; you can see that my city found me 
then put me on stages to me that's amazing
to you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this




i'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
you're trying to keep it deprived and only co sign what radio does
and i'm looking right past you; we live in a world we live in a world 
on two different axles; you live in a world you living behind the mirror
i know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital i know you had to; this shit is vital i know you had to
to die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
give me a feasible gain rather a seasonal name; i'll let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
i'mma break out and then hide every lock i'mma break out and then hide every lock

  


bitch don't kill my vibe; you ain't heard a chorus 
like this in a long time   don't you see that long line
and they waiting on kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
threes in the air i can see you are in sync
hide your feelings hide your feelings now what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
walk out the door and they scream it's alive
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
talk too motherfucking much i got my drink i got my music
i say bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe bitch don't kill my vibe


"ay k dot get in the car nigga
come on we finna roll out

so i'm saying "what up what up nigga you made it" 
frustrated and i'm riding down the back streets
making my conscious ask me
"would i survive to make it up out this hole in time"
black boy fly 
black black boy fly
black boy fly


i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors a sponsor of basketball scholars
it's 2004 and i'm watching him score 30
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall he focused on math
determination ambition plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy fly


black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy


i used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
war's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its 2004 and i'm hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes i'm like oh shit wait
don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasn't real
be honest none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy fly




my mama didn't raise me up to be jealous hearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay hold your head and continue marching
that's what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
and shortly i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggaz facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when 2 niggaz making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggaz making it out that's mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly
out of compton

thank god
black boy fly watch that black boy fly 
playas always tryin to pop bottles
niggas love to pop bottles
man get you a table my nigga
go get you a table my nigga

sit down  stand up

yeah spread yo wings you probably won't get far

try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya

howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies

refrigerators barbecue pits and jordan kicks

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby


look inside these walls and you see them havin' withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you i'm tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that i'm easily prey i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity building it's probably big as a building
me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
but what am i supposed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i ain't but know i'm accustomed to
just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place they was wonderin' if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i don't mind because one day you'll respect the good kid maad city




all i see is strobe lights blinding me in my hindsight
findin' me by myself promise me you can help 
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standin' still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask "lift up your shirt" cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter "he's probably young but i know that he's down"
step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
he don't mind he know we'll never respect the good kid maad city




all i see in this room 20 xanies and these 'shrooms
grown up candy for pain can we live in a sane society
it's entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with 20 xanies and 'shrooms
some grown up candy i lost it i feel it's nothing to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
don't mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid maad city

be the last one out to get this dough no way
love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
hit the streets then we break the code no way
hit the brakes when they on patrol no way


imagine rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
santa claus don't miss them stockings liquor spillin' pistols poppin'
bakin' soda yola whippin' ain't no turkey on thanksgiving
my homeboy just domed a nigga i just hope the lord forgive him
pots with cocaine residue everyday i'm hustlin'
what else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
gotta provide for my daughter n'em get the fuck up out my way bish
got that drum and got them bands just like a parade bish
drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys don't see my stash
if they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
from the gardens where the grass ain't cut them serpents lurkin' blood
bitches sellin' pussy niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
broken promises steal your watch and tell you what time it is
take your j's and tell you to kick it where a foot locker is
in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree


waking up in a dream
sleepwalking on another big stage
you never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
your name and your song i'm so far away
from the place i used to be struggling usually
look at the newer me fate pursuing me
i can feel the energy in the air
it feel like i'm supposed to be here


everywhere i go i'm getting so much love
fans the stars everyone
sayin how they can't wait for the lp
and i'm gonna blow
feel so good in what you do
helps somebody else get through
that's why i do the best i can
because i know how blessed i am


i'm so high i can touch the sky
i know it's my time and it's now or never
i'm so bright i light the night
and it feels so right ain't nothing better


a fool if i take it all for granted
a smart man if i keep my feet planted to the earth
cuz the people that hurt can't understand it
you speakin outlandish i'm ashamed how to make it all work
another planet it's a short term role for me
i rec it's all for me it's just mo with me
and you're here for you too here can re persevere
defenses i yet feel relentless
ambition with a clear vision
takin off i ain't takin off these pistons
i'm takin off on the enemies your distance
came across me how much it'd cost me to get you out my business
i said a planet is a shortterm goal no sky is the limit
i'm past that now pass that
a word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours


i see myself performing at
soldout shows where the room is packed
sitting at the grammys winning 5 awards
see myself on big billboards
climbing round the world would endorse me deals
can't imagine how it feels
that's why i'm smiling every day
cause my dream ain't far away




you're looking at me and tell me i'm blessed
calculating my steps my heart my breath
breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when i'm at my best my worse
this verse is dedicated to the days that i slept with the curse
research my paid dues i'm reimbursed
i burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
i'm a king on a prowl and i see mama smile
and the vow i'mma take that i'll never break
you can break bread with me now we can all take a bow
on the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
that we made it off the avenue i walk then down in the darkness
i often sit back and get lost in the rap that i root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talkin to you i was walkin it through
heavy ghetto tail of success hello


and i'm so happy i cry
cause i can't believe
all the things i ever wanted
are finally happening for me
and it's so surreal
that i almost feel
that any minute i can wake up
from this fantasy
when you play so hard
and you've come so far
and you go that is the time for you to leave your more
and i'm gonna do it
watch me

   2x
i recognize your fragrance 
you ain't never gotta say shit 
and i know your taste is
a little bit  high maintenance 
everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
and you're in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
better yet when your friends and them
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and
y'all curled in that little bitty range i heard that
she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
nigga don't approach her with that atari
nigga that ain't good game homie sorry
they say conversation rule a nation i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
'less i write it down for real ps


you can get it you can get it
you can get it you can get it
and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want poetic justice put it in a song


i really hope you play this
cause ol' girl you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
you've been taken
clearly a lot for me to take in
it don't make sense
young east african girl you too busy fucking with your other man
i was trying to put you on game put you on a plane
take you and your mama to the motherland
i could do it maybe one day
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
when you figure out it's all right here in the city
and you don't run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice poetic justice
you were so new to this life but god damn you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress 
good god what you doing that walk for
when i see that thing move i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
and they say communication saves relations i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs unless i write them down for real
ps




every time i write these words they become a taboo
making sure my punctuation curve
every letter is true
living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talking poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb it's you looking in the mirror
love is not just a verb it's you looking poor maybe
call me crazy we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common
and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb and i can see power steering
sex drive when you swerve i want that interference
it's coherent i can hear it mmhmm
that's your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me mmhmm
breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely yours truly
and right before you go blind
ps


pour up  head shot 
sit down  stand up 
pass out  wake up 
faded  faded 


now i done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
i was in a dark room loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up fillin' up my cup i see the crowd move
changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me


nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
pool full of liquor then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
pool full of liquor i'ma dive in it




"okay now open your mind up and listen to me kendrick
i am your conscience if you do not hear me then you will be history kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory kendrick"
if i take another one down i'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe i see the love in her eyes
i see the feelin' the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
this how you capitalize this is parental advice then apparently
i'm over influenced by what you are doin' i thought i was doin' the most then someone said to me

  


i ride you ride bang
one chopper one hundred shots bang
hop out do you bang
two chopper two hundred shots bang

  



pool full of liquor then you dive in in in in 

w watch 'em all f flock  
 girls wanna play play play

p pool full of liquor i'ma d i i iive in it


all i all i all i all i all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane tell me do that sound familiar
if it do then you're like me makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open i release everything that corrode inside of me
i see you jokin' why you laugh don't you feel bad i probably sleep 
and never ever wake up never ever wake up never ever wake up
in god i trust but just when i thought i had enough
i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say when i feel
and i look in the mirror and know i'm there
with my hands in the air i'm proud to say yeah
i'm real i'm real i'm really really real 


i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him you love them you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love red bottom and gold with the sequin
you love hand bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mold that's green i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you can't see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks you'll still say you're lovely
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and dead presidents old
you love fast women you love keepin' control
of everything that you love you love beef
you love streets you love runnin' duckin' police
you love your hood might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself




the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a don't come free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word "but" but what if i got love
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause you're the girl i attract
i love second verse cause you're the homie that packed
burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much i don't love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i don't love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that i'm season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility i'm talkin' about
hatin' all money power respect in my will
or hating the fact none of that shit make me real


"kenny i ain't trippin' off that dominos anymore just calling 
sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but don't learn the hard way like i did homie
any nigga can kill a man that don't make you a real nigga
real is responsibility real is taking care of your motherfucking family real is god nigga"




"alright that's all i wanted to tell you
just make sure you call us back when you get this message
here go your mom"


"boy you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car but look i ain't trippin 
look the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there 
by food for less and they was preaching to you over there telling you
about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need 
oh and top dawg called the house too 
i guess they want you and dave to come to the studio 
but look you take this music business serious and put out something me and your dad can step to 
shit you know we from chicago you know that's what we do"


sing my song it's all for you 


"if i don't hear from you by tomorrow i hope you come back and learn from your mistakes 
come back a man tell your story to these black and brown kids in compton
let 'em know you was just like them
but you still rose from that dark place of violence becoming a positive person 
but when you do make it give back with your words of encouragement
and that's the best way to give back 
to your city and i love you kendrick
if i don't hear you knocking on the door you know where i usually leave the key 
alright talk to you later bye"

i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians push an '04 mercedes benz
"hello my name is kendrick" she said "no you're handsome"
whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin'
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now 
"where you stay" she said "down the street from dominguez high"
okay i know that's borderline compton or paramount; "well is it compton"
"no" she replied and quickly start battin' her eyes and
i strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful "what you tryna get into"
she didn't tell just gave me her nextel
dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well
the summer had passed and now i'm likin' her
conversation we having probably enticin' her
who could imagine maybe my actions would end up wifin' her
love or lust regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
it's deep rooted the music of bein' young and dumb
it's never muted in fact it's much louder where i'm from
we know a lot 'bout each other her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers
her favorite cousin demetrius's irrepetible
family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
but not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"i wanna come over what's up" that's what i told her 
soon as this episode of "martin" go off i'm tryin' to get off
i was in heat like a cactus my tactics of bein' thirsty
probably could hurt me but fuck it i got some heart
grab my momma's keys hopped in the car then oh boy
so now i'm down rosecrans in a caravan
passin' alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
i'm thinkin' bout that sex   thinkin' bout her thighs 
or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what positions next
sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
i looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
and i'm a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i'm hopin' to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
i'm two blocks away 250 feet
and six steps from where she stay she wavin' me 'cross the street
i pulled up a smile on my face and then i see
two niggas two black hoodies i froze as my phone rang
when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me


i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow i'm hopin' that i can borrow
a peace of mind i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted i find nothin' but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering "get 'em"
i got 'em and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality that told my brother not to duck
in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun ta duns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child i'm proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'ma push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope 

   minus first two lines


you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it "section80" the message resembled "brenda's got a baby"
what's crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judgin' her past and shit
well it's completely my future her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
and i'ma need that 40 dollars
even if i gotta fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park i'm followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin' keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss 'em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em back
to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn something
then you probably need to beat her that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted but fuck that "sorry for your loss" shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you tryin' to gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in i'll wait
 your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure i'm not in the song
cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctor's approval is a waste of time i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away i'll never fade away i know my fate
and i'm on the grind for this cake i'ma get or die tryin'
i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
 you lyin' to these motherfuckers talkin' about you can help 'em
with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
don't ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit




sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away it it's today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if i'm doomed
may the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the scheme of wonderin' when i'ma rest
and you're right your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the tv screen
by any means wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
her personal life i was like "it need to be told"
cursin' the life of 20 generations after her soul
exactly what'd happen if i ain't continued rappin'
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong
fightin' for your rights even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
now am i worth it 
did i put enough work in 

   minus first two lines


promise that you'll sing about me forever
promise that you'll sing about me for ooohhh
i am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me lord forgive me things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone bitch don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away
i got my drink i got my music i would share it but today 
i'm yellin' "bitch don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
bitch don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe"

 that whatever the mind can conceive and believe the mind can achieve
 regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
 or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"


go getter with no cheddar

so welcome to the story of my life

make a fortune buy some porsches for my momma and the wife
pop's engine in this old school run tight~
but as you listening to k d o t
me and my girl split the bucket at kfc
she listening to drake and all i can say
damn these niggas that much better than me
baby i don't think this is meant to be
cause i'm always losing self esteem
she paused the iphone then said huh
i repeated what i said then she replied shut up
you know you the best boy you gotta keep doing it
but don't forget when you do just keep you in it
and never listen to what the industry say
don't be a typical artist be more like jay
russell barry gordy quincy jones
bob johnson sean combs la reid
young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed yeah
so i gotta see success
i gotta make it off them rosecrans steps
rising to the top like a soda shook up
bout to pop and i'll pop on whoever's in my way




yeah i swear to god i don't wanna do it just live man
i wanna live good
just wanna make my momma proud y'know
i don't wanna be hard i don't want the most stripes
i got lil' brothers and sisters man i'm the oldest nigga
i just want it i just want it
and i'ma get it
cloud nine kendrick lamar uh
i take a sip of hennessy and then get pissy drunk
i ain't a drinker i'm a thinker call it what you want
but if you turn your back know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i started questioning god what is my purpose
he say to live the way he did that's all he want from me
spread the word and witness he rose on the first sunday
i said alright enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible and searched to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit my life is so fucked up man i can't help but give in
i'm giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how i was truly blessed
felt like i'm free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again


what am i gonna do gotta have faith
life is too much understood where is your faith
oh faaaaaaaith
all you need is the size of a mustard seed


single black parent from compton raising children of four
that's four innocent bastards cause papa they don't know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
her baby daddy ain't bout shit that nigga ain't bout shit
spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
she thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the devil is a lie make a better choice
and so it's back to mcdonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail lost her section 8
then lost her faith again




kendrick i appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
this about how faith works yeah murk it 
i had dreams of holding a nine milla to ray's killer
ask him why as my eyes fill up
each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas
it's a jungle when the niggas in zoo
the rat's lurking vulture's circling the serpents
cats lying through they teeth my nigga didn't deserve it
i flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
it's ill to see my faith try and leave me
it's so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy
i'm tryna reach cloud nine that's what my niggas bout
but it never rain in california 'less them pistols out
until then my feet planted on the ground
shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
and if i get no answer just know i tried
i should have never looked into his son's eyes
ray charles voice




this for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your mind's slipping wondering is there really a god
knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
but whenever it's pain that feeling forever remains
we can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers that's human nature you ain't in the wrong
just know when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i ain't never caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better or i don't know no better
but what i do know is that he's real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your world's about to end
i hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

i'd rather not live like there isn't a god
than die and find out there really is think about it
a nigga so goddamn stressed out
i feel like fuck everything right now
see i've been broke too long can't find a job to save my life
but i'll be damned if i give 'em a handout
see my pride is one thing i will not put aside
i'm too proud to beg i'm sorry left eye
if i don't make it in life motherfucker i tried
what uh


you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you
not your momma your poppa only person is you
not your brother your sister the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you
nobody nobody but you
so it feels like like it's only you


so i'm feeling like i want to i want to
i want to i want to go so far from here
very very far from here
i need to i need to
i need to i need to go so far from here
very very far from here


it seems like you can't win for losing
whatever you're doing turns out to be "what are you doing"
sitting pursuing but your time will soon come
nobody knows the position that you in
but it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
that feeling hard to explain
when you just just want to get away
something like






away from it all
take me out of hell where only heaven can visit
the smartest astronomers they won't even see my vision
i'm stuck on the studio couch now i'm thinking bout my daughter
times is getting harder another beat is slaughtered
just press record or seems like i need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
from my hat to my shoes spirit laced with pride
set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
reaching for the skies pissing on a cloud
shitting on a bird's head higher than a dread
as i fly through the galaxy pain and the agony
nothing is surrounding me living my life
though it's better to write
configuring my style to the streets bring dark to the light
so how you feel my nigga i keep it real
a schoolboy soon to be star mr lamar


see y'all don't understand me
my plan be is to win y'all hearts before i win a grammy

he pumped reeboks his uncles pumped packs
punk fake jump shot ball hit the back
ball dreams of being point guard was off limits jack

uh i just wanna be me
no disrespect but motherfuck you
my education stopped at a high school degree
but i can outsmart any high iq
draped in some fly shit call me jeff goldblum
cold my style making my nose run
oh i stare at the mirror then realize
that real lies within me
some say i'm crazy cause i think like i need a shrink
ask too many questions about the stars and earth shit
rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
so if i'm not clubbing don't think i'm on some jerk shit
and california on that jerk shit
but i'd just rather two step like my first steps
jill scott in my ipod as my head rests yes




and yeah i know i'm from compton cali'
but i don't lace up chucks or rock tan khakis
and skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
i probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
ha ha ha i like to joke got a sense of humor
stale face play me short like an oompa loompa
you ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
won't you lighten up like michael did
i grew up with killers man people who killed man
but my character never could be like them man
and they respect that say that i'm real man
not a fake person that's the sims man
live my life through some film man
i ain't acting out shit i be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know kendrick fo' sho' and oh




almost lost my life to the industry
had to look through a photo book to remember me
these label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
have you with professional killers chasing hits
lying to yourself all over an image
making records they want that was wrecking my brilliance
my mama said boy that don't sound like you
i said this is the sound though my only excuse
quite frankly dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate make these motherfuckers hate me
the reason why they hate cause these motherfuckers ain't me
and you can underrate me but i know what i'm worth
a diamond in god's dirt a diamond in winter
watching simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
see i give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

i think that i finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
the world is so typical
i just wanna be higher than that
i used to want to be the messiah of rap
infatuated with becoming a relevant star
trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that i never had but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
vanity they say that it can damage me
so do i really want it
if i didn't i guess i'm a cool cocaine connect
that means i'll be fronting hmm
cooking in a laboratory hoping i can tell a story
that the whole world can feel like the ones that came before me
knowing that i'm misunderstood
so i gotta get my point across like a snitch would
and i would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
and dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all i could say is will the radio care
yeah or should i say no
or should i just stop and come with a whole new approach
you heard my hip hop when i was sixteen years old
well that was me then now i'm an adult
twenty two like the smallest of guns that you know most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show but i'm not worried
my talent should take me places i've never been
the world should turn soon as my record spin
i wanna be the highest on top of all the bullshit
the negative you bring the stress the violence
the capital punishment the loud police sirens
too focussed one word righteous
and this is kendrick lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
and that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed one word 
mm yeah
that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed one word


too focussed too focussed one word
too focussed too focussed one word
too focussed too focussed one word
too focussed one word

"how was your flight mr lamar
 good hope to see you next time"
i was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
a letter in reply seven days later
after i wrote him "stay strong keep your faith in god"
what i told him hoping that he's listening
said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
what a coincidence i was bumping some plies
i can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
i know it gotta be hard being twenty one
doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
your brother's getting older and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
sleeping in a cell it's been thirty weeks
ain't received any mail it's cold and the hole stinks
and you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
as i read every word that you write i can only imagine
jason keaton i can only imagine yeah


life's about decisions man
it's in your hand and you got it
just take control if you can
it's in your hand and you got it


sitting on the couch that was my uncle bobby
after he just got out fifteen years to count
haven't seen the world in so long haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
trying to get his life together or whatnot
typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
got it straight got a place found some serenity
found a job found his mother gravesite found a forty ounce
then he found god then he bounced
then he found a new chick two kids wide hips
found something in her we didn't see
found this spot in pasadena and shacked with her an investment
then found guilty somebody had yelled domestic
violence on my uncle was working with two strikes
only out a year now facing life i can only imagine
that's fucked up i can only imagine uncle bob




sitting on the couch thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities system grab more of these
eighteen year olds eighteen year sentence
with no parole the state won't oversee
they make the term severe a conspiracy
that's what i call it it's full of shit a toilet can help quick
the government help no just put us on death row
just give us some more guns then give us some more coke
then give us another chair then give us some more rope
then hang it like right there yeah it's justice for all
but ninety percent unfair care nah
alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand more prisons
so these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
they for grossing a bigger business imagine
we being used imagine the truth shall be told


uh uh uh what up
uh i'm tryna what up
uh uh i'm tryna get something
uh uh uh i'm tryna what up
i say what up
uh uh i'm tryna

sometimes i wanna leave sometimes i wanna cry
sometimes i hate to bear the truth sometimes i wanna lie
sometimes i wanna school the youth sometimes i wanna ride
sometimes i wanna not think sometimes i wanna vibe
sometimes i wanna bump tribe and zone out this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
we kill the facades we feel free to fly
we're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
i care about my pride too much if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush if my hair is cut if my diamonds is crushed
i look in the mirror i'm trendy enough wrong
insecurity roams the black community
homes where kids must have jewelry
the high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
the various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price but more like the right scam
to rule us all confuse us all
hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a range that is not paid for
my cousin from the south said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
so why fast forward then i rewind
a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
picking cotton from a field that a white man own
the blacker you are farther you from the white man's home
negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
before your vanity they parted our families
they put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
the more we were afraid the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage our freedom was so fake
couldn't see it with the eyes of tracee ross uh~
and school was exempt see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt wound diversed from a scar
four hundred years of nothing four hundred years of suffering
four hundred years of tears and tribulation miseducation
see what we facing is now coming back to the roots
remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness we captured these feelings in things that we do
thought it's abstinence in slavery but we made it come to
a modern perspective my shoe selection gotta be louie
her handbag gotta be gucci it's fake then she foobie
she still bad though and her fake gucci ain't that bad though
we filling up the gas for rollies
upgrade to twenty sixes out there riding kobes
my cousin from the south slavery start in the south and i bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
so blame it on the four hundred years we never saw
the reason why the next four hundred we gotta floss
slaves

uh i say the four hundred years we never had nothing
barely had clothes on our back
it's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over exaggerate on our living expenses
so if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
you're a vanity slave
if you're a female and you got four five six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
you're a vanity slave
if you got an '02 monte carlo with twenty fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe"
you're a vanity slave
we all vanity slaves
and with that being said can somebody please tell me where the mall at
i'm not from around here
hey ali where we at idaho
yeah nigga you know the first of the month
you know them checks come in
i'm tryna get something but what up
it's like i don't think you fully understand who i am y'know
i'm just a good kid from compton that wanna rap
i don't represent no colors i represent my lil' sisters and brothers
i'm the oldest nigga
and if you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
check it out

i used to wanna rap like jay z
until i finally realised that jay wasn't me
i took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
critics say i don't be killing this shit but i know i do
because i used to practice early morning and then after school
i'm working on my hooks my nigga i ain't tryna battle you
but even if i did i guarantee i'd overshadow you
like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
i'ma close cut to common and gucci mane
now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
because i can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
i wear a heart on my shoulder
'member when we used to make the boost look like motorola
your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
then went to jail when we got older
that shit is a bad odor but still i remain focussed
in due time i'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
that shit's embarrassing huh
hope no one pay you no mind
but it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
can you relate to my story can you follow my dreams
and admirations that i had ever since i was thirteen
my momma believed in me she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty that's who i do it fo'
my pops got a different approach yeah he believed
but he always questioned when i'ma drop my debut cd
how long this gon' take nigga you still haven't ate nigga
at twenty two i had two cars and my own place nigga
it's a sacrifice i try to tell him
that's when he turn to bet and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
i ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
i just wanna hear you heard


yep yep that's my word
make a statement with these nouns and verbs
i represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
listen to my nouns and verbs 
like a cattle with sheep
while y'all sleep i re up cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
motherfuck what a critic got to say i'ma be heard


what up dasan i ain't forgot nigga
you developed me telling me i was hot nigga
you believed in me first that's what's for sure
at the church recording at the garage but it worked
but me and dave kind of felt you lost the passion
a lot was going on in your life and you needed space
but still i should have came to you first to tell you what happened
but i was seventeen and figured it's best i stay away
and i wrong i was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what i'd done
but i'm telling you we ain't done
matter of fact how's your sons what they up to
remember they used to run around while you had worked on protools
people i used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning yawning but i was on it
me you and dave was on it
buzzing like charlotte hornets when that tape dropped
where them beats nigga it's been five years since we had rocked
time to be heard




so can you feel it
when you hear it do it pulsate your spirit
do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick
the truth can set you free if you do the right thing
word to spike lee don't he look like sounwave
that's kinda random but my humor sometimes strays like a dog in the night
twenty four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen then send your dog a kite
i spread love like a hippy but i'm a black one
with jesus christ passion i swear on the bible
tabernacle to all my rivals i ain't mad
you hate a nigga for tryna help you that's your bad
because i figure i can make a way with these stanzas
i probably can't heal cancer but i can heal the city
my niggas tell me you with me
and if you is won't you pop my cd in
open up your trunk then let it bump so i can be heard
yeah uh huh




d dave what up nigga
matt jeezy 
she look better than beyonce alicia keys halle berry miss jolie

i'm glad i found you
so pretty
i'll never do anything to hurt you
the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
that's the hardest thing

who is k dot a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary relatives in high school
with that being said each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head i needed survival
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
and i don't even push a line i'm just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider that if it goes down
they'll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what i'm doing
i'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue and real talk and


this is why they fuck with me 
this is why they fuck with me 
i'm no gangster no killer i'm just your average joe 
but one thing you should consider i'm the realest you know


i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up and i was like hold up
where you from "i don't bang"
where you stay "westside" that's a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul de sac
shots rang out hoping to god i wasn't wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninety five they said they already knew
what happened and meet 'em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
grabbed the nine ball opened up the door then got in
somebody said fall back we gon' make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat and that's just to remind you
thought about that so long i had failed my finals fuck but


this is why they fuck with me 
this is why they fuck with me 
i'm no gangster no killer i'm just your average joe 
but one thing you should consider i'm the realest you know


i don't do black music i don't do white music
i do everyday life music
give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through but i've been through it now that's cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps no power steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died it's no joke
don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed you smoke that but i'm high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
in other words we get it cracking but i keep it cool y'know


this is why they fuck with me 
this is why they fuck with me 
i'm no gangster no killer i'm just your average joe 
but one thing you should consider i'm the realest you know


so there you have it
but i'ma leave you with this
an og once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
i'm gone
one time
reporting live compton california

have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never get right sort of like a black sheep
back down backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
oh what a cold world for a broke nigga it's bitter
and life's a bitch don't hit women so i bit her
i struck enough pain let her know i wasn't playing
i was so sincere like nas' first name
in belly they'd tell me it's very difficult to see twenty five
and if i survive i probably wouldn't sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heals like giuseppe's
they want me unemployed until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke d boys selling weed
fucking up my prestige till i live with the blues
bb king or the neighbors of snoop

    
that's why i'm in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life life life
and if you say i can't live comfortable
i'ma tell you that's a lie lie lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past


so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past



have you ever felt like like you never get life
like you never did right sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration see what the people saying
she gon' have a baby then flee from her education
at the age of sixteen credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye boyfriend brutality
she will never get by no how no way
welfare recipient property of the state
housing section 8 corner store prostitute
the owner bout to prosecute the niggas tell her that she cute
hoodrat trashy six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies waiting on the first
fast forward spilling drinks on her fur

    
that's why she in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life life life
and if you say she can't live comfortable
she gon' tell you that's a lie lie lie
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past


so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past



have you ever felt like you finally got life
you finally got right no longer a black sheep
living off your dreams like christina uh milian in the front seat
of a convertible eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
it's like you just hit the lottery my god
there must be a god cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling ali
now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
and she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
making good decisions got an independent business mind
and both of y'all are steady grinding doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they won't give you the credit disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out

  
in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life life life
and if you say they can't live comfortable
they gon' tell you that's a lie lie lie
so even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path



just laugh then everybody say


cause i won't get caught again
and i'm here to start the trend
you can't catch me if you try
disappear into the night and i'm gone


"so you made it past all the barbed wires"
just one more left 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
ali you thirsty on twitter 
you boo boo you t
you turned down you thirsty
you boo boo

uh i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna find myself i'm searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water i'll just wait at the dock
and by the way i'ma start finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
i'm back chilling with a friend of mine she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight who wearing a weave
who dooney & bourke bag is fake who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear getting on my nerves
but before your negative energy curve bitch i'ma cut you off


cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say oh my god
shut the fuck up hoe
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say


uh i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it t a k e just to reach the t o p
i'm talking ideas motivation
it's more than making enemies my nigga
oh that's not your memo then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed him at the monte crystal
where so and so from and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby momma's a rat and who got killed last weekend
that shit is mad depressing bringing me down
speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger pussy nigga i'ma cut you off


cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say oh my god
shut the fuck up scary ass
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say


uh i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
i'm tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa studying art
now paint that picture life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught
i murdered a rapper and you filed the police report
see what i was taught family is all i need
but indeed them too can run me right up a tree
constantly talking shit bout the next relative
wanting me to take sides but i'd never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays left my uncle in prison
for fifteen years no one paid him attention but moms
yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people dang
and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
i would probably cut y'all off too yep


cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say oh my god
shut the fuck up keep it running ali
every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop de whoop blase blah
he say she say


so tell 'em shut the fuck up
tell 'em shut the fuck up
yeah bitch you boo boo you t
you turned down you thirsty
tell 'em shut the fuck up

you thirsty you t
you boo boo you turned down
you boo boo you t
you turned down you weak
you weak yo' bitch weak
yeah 
you boo boo you t 
keep all that


what is hiiipower
hiiipower is the way we think the way we live
see it's known today that the human race is nothing
no moral no standards
what we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you don't have to have a lot of money
you don't have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say it's as big as a crew some say it's as big as a gang
hiiipower we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion
where are we going why are we slowing down
where are you going we should be growing now


smoke to it nigga smoke to it nigga




that's what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile i'm in these streets with everybody
i'm trying to get it and she know they got me i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters don't reach you i hope these lyrics in sync




that's what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten i'm off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten alcoholic tripping
fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
club night guys and dolls
balling out but i'm bout to drop the ball
i'm calling out for help my engineer called
told me come to the studio i wanna tell him nah




that's what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and forty four can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i don't know
i know to follow him rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means i'm following evil
guess i'm following evil i should follow cathedral
blessings i need but live like i don't need you




so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to what's important in my life i apologize
i promise to stay faithful focussed and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards
would you not know how to act or take action it's just a part of life
and if your vision's impaired you probably lose it all tonight


i'm trying to visualize how to get it right
but my vision's so blurry
trying to slow it down stay close to the ground
but we're always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world stand a little slower
then i would then we could grow a little closer
i think we're getting closer
i think we're getting closer
i'll tell you what i don't believe in can i do that
alright i don't believe in the in laws or the system by any means whatsoever
i try not to obey them at any time
that's what i believe in not believing in

four big bottles of water a day two packs of marlboro reds and
uh what keeps me alive shit um
music i have to listen to music all day long
i'd say that keeps me going
i'm a pretty dark person i've thought about ending it a million times
and i have to say that music keeps me here by far the main thing


thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now freestyle or write down whatever
and still i come up clever i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better but i ain't perfect
i ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead die trying and know death
might end up dead swallow blood swallow my breath
fuck a funeral just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have and victory tastes sweet
even when an enemy can throw salt
still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
let bygones be bygones but where i'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
i'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
my uncle doing life inside prison he wasn't wrapped too tight
he told me rap about life not rap niggas
that's why i'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up would just come up
we used to beefing over turf fuck beefing over a verse
niggas dying motherfuck a double entendre
and this is compton lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fo' fo's like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i "wanna be heard" and wonder who i am
you probably even listened to "faith" and think i know zion
but really i'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright i'd probably go blind before i blink twice i ain't lying
i swear to god half of y'all cats just don't know kendrick
the school of hard knocks we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block he got shot you are no eyewitness
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head kneel down and then tie your tennis
it's kinda scary ain't it
you can't act like no bitch that only got tyler perry famous
just let me explain it why you pick up that stainless
cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
said if you'd see him on them bleachers then you'd kill him facing
twenty five to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still won't break my promise i promise to keep it honest
secret society all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and i'm like the kendrick lamar od in less than a month
alright gotta keep it pushing
can't let the government tell me how my future looking
i'm on rosecrans & central tryna duck the central bookings
if the fucking pigs get behind me then you know i'm bucking never will i surrender
i've been a warrior when i came out of my mom's placenta
in the gutter lane like i'm master splinter
how splendid i guess my project had did it
got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
they said seven tracks i said fifteen
called it an ep they said i'm tripping
but little did they know i'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to so the corporate won't make decisions
uppity bitches handling bidness
killing our dreams stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
in la everybody think they fucking on
hop on twitter perpetrate we doing big shit
who we hanging with and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god most of y'all cats just don't know kendrick
you barely know yourself so i guess most of y'all should be offended
ain't doing this for my health i'm tryna purchase my momma them benzes
occupy my time with riches justify my time ambition's
just to coincide just to go inside books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind took the master's mind just the perfect time just to master mine
just to master grind with precision look the mastermind took the 


we would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the kendrick lamar ep
for this is the kendrick lamar od
because of you we are overly dedicated
niggas hating bitches hating babies dying
bullets flying helicopters police sirens preachers lying
genosism criticism unemployment racism
burning buildings aids victims cancer killing no cure
oil spilling turmoil poverty stricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison child molesting
cow intestines botox injection earthquakes that's government testing
secret society weapon opium plant manifested
that turn to crack then invest it amongst us blacks just a method
to hold us back great depression amongst iraq no direction
no google map just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu then blah blah blah adolescents go cuckoo
mothers are boo boo crying the governor keep us starving
these commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph distinctive living with science
no place to live in no zion see that's forbidden we frying

"my nigga what it look like"
that's exactly what hell look like uh


tell it like it is nigga
tell it like it is homeboy
tell it like it is nigga
tell it like it is tell 'em what's up

on your corner coroners comfort your mama mama he's dead the next morning
high toasted up with my homies we drink and smoke marijuana

uncles that raised me in compton ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know i don't have conscience i just load up and start dumping
on enemies i'm head hunting no sympathy ain't no love when

for set respects split your onion then chop your deck your head tumbling like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

die young corpse identified by your parents apparently you a parrot
mocking me and my blueprint but i won't share it

all my uncles sir smokers
on alondra in front of our building
they was my heroes


this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
bad bitches crackheads street niggas crackheads
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead


uh and that's scary to me
dope beat dope flow vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
nigga cue me in i'm a peruvian drug lord
don't fast forward i'ma serve you some keys
this is crack cocaine i'm kurt cobain
and i bang like a c r i p
p i r u high you i'm an i v
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack stop
i said an i v cause when i be
in the studio i shot a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
i'm cold on a cold turkey i hate chickens
but i do fuck pretty birdies where your girl at
over the pyrex where my world at




uh and that's scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
you pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
zs on k dot uh uh better wake up
a nightmare i'm right there like a siamese
twin when you motherfuckers gon' learn
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly i'm a red eye with eyedrops
i big i 'pac you chris i rock
that's pookie on new jack head first with a cyclops
i'm the first one to do that i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone who you got to tell on
if it ain't about me about hoe
or be about face if you ain't on higher learning
there's soda in the pot and the fire burning




uh and it's scary to carry
a smooth type flow like a drink of merlot
that'll freak y'all out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track it's a reynolds wrap
and i rap like a nigga who invented rap rapping heat
you could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess i'm the blood sacrifice
of the party i undress her like a harley
lights will flash cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed put it on my tab




aw dude you about to fucking od bro
uh yeah *3x*
uh
we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people
i'm inspired so get inspired

and so he said why you gotta be so kind hearted
why you couldn't be a con artist why you couldn't
why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started
why you never ask for nothing just a lil' time
why you let me use yours cause i don't got mines
why you always lift me up when i'm completely giving up
or when niggas holler what's up you give a dry response
why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it
why you always buy me something when you going shopping
why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too
why you making promises that you'll forever do
whatever just to make me happy wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you sometimes

  
we hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us love people that hurt us



and so she said why you gotta be so mean to me
why you don't know what you mean to me
why you always playing games why i feel like you ashamed
out in public curse me out and make a scenery
why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy
why you treat me like i'm nothing why you always at a function
i be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex
why you always assuming that i still love my ex
every time we get into it i'm the one that's feeling stupid
you don't need me you gon' leave me that's your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely
why i feel i'm the last option after your homies
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me sometimes




she says she loves me she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when i want to be left alone
but she's beautiful
like sometimes when i have things on my mind she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice she says when i give her a cue
she says she loves me
like when i wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food wanting to feed me
she says she needs me she says she loves me
or like when i'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel wanting to wanting to dry me off
she says she says she loves me
so instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says she says she loves me
and i don't know about love
"gina baby i don't have no money and i don't have no ends
 gina i'm ass out" 
"i'm going through something right now"
"i told you that"

to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the ever hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain problem and sorrow
just for a minute then back to the bullshit
your car now due and you bout to get evicted
two drugs surely patron pussy make it feel alright
but once it's empty and the bitch leave then it's back to life
you can't run from it gotta run to it nigga
the antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga
but still you proceed to dive deep ask what's her zodiac sign

you know a knock out and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black shrivel up and drop out
there we go again what the fuck you talking bout
we used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
smoking beedies laying on the futon
memories i got saved up like a coupon
and we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
i was broke then couldn't count the best weed
then she would just leave in a black hatchback
homies from the hood used to ask me if i'd tapped that
i would say yep smiling so freely
that was back then but i bet she still need me
she need me she need me

somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo i'm tryna get blown
i'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my cadillac brown looking for et to phone home
tadow the flavor i kick reminisce the good days
thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the rollie chains
pro club t shirts whiter than anglo saxons
make it a 1x tall crispy with the cotton fashion
that's fashion if you come where i'm from
compton california one love to the murder capital under the sun
young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
but i don't trip i still dip like salsa to a chip
rolling down rosecrans to scoop up my man a mack
he talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes believe that
and so i scooped him round 3:30
telling me it's all good tiger woods now we looking for the birdy birdies
stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
pulled up on the breezies well what do you know i think they love us


and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets rollie
chain wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth yeah you know we got it going on
and if you feel good

represent the city like you know you should 
i want to make sure that you understood we got it going on

as i continue my day quite copacetic
headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout hungry as hell
had the right grub i bail need some gas
arco station on avalon a relative hit me up as he rolled past
we used to stand in line for jordans excited we got 'em
rocking platinum fubu jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
throwback jerseys chamberlain and james worthy was two of my favorites
i might pull out the green larry bird on special occasions
but anyway i'm steady coasting smoking on that hiroshima
ashtray got a million roaches i'm focussed but feeling good
the homies hanging on  and monte carlos
impalas and  shoot something nigga break that fifty
i'm grabbing the city like i'm supposed to
making my presence/presents felt like christmas day what can i say
every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a g
if you can't relate then please have a seat




so wherever you located won't you let it be known
and put on for the soil of which you was grown
i put on like brand new chuck taylors while giving you cuts
like fresh tapers i'm such a fool with it go nuts
you bullshitting like tuck the bounce then untuck
the bounce then throw up a rare jewel you duck
take 'em to school i must this for the cool in us
this ain't for you so what


it feels like i only go backwards baby

i got my hopes up again oh no not again
feels like we only go backwards darling


and we'll be screaming out "no rules no rules"
feel the energy we go through i told you
pump my fist like i'm supposed to i showed you
my vision of the unsocial is so cool
look around me and just see the same who to blame
see my generation has no shame i play the game
how i see it this is inside the future this is nothing that you're used to
i refuse to play the victim my religion is to move you
out your power position my army head on collision
cant harm me out of my own skin government need assistance
every time that i zone in
nothing is more convincing than telling you that i won't bend
break or fake partition
i can't this is my life design
this is me taking mines this is what i live for
this is me taking yours this is more than c4
this is what happens when we're ready to build and destroy
i hope that you enjoy


it feels like i only go backwards baby
every part of me says "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again oh no not again

i live my life a rebel a vigilante devils try to get at me
pedal through this underworld undertakers won't catch me
system make no sense don't feel justice if you would ask me
i'll tell you everything is corrupted don't you walk passed me
with the condescending look i can tell you're pretending
like you my friends and you just a henchman i feel relentless
i feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
or cut you with it i come from a glove that breed a nuisance
trespass on your property i am properly aiming to go and get your democracy
this is me changing faces cuz i can stand alone and die alone as long as i got pride
the victory and fight is all in my eyes
the night is young and i can see your demise
i'm waiting for it
you can't ignore it you live dormant
i die enormous
big as the lies you tell i can tell that you feel defeated
the truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason
capisce

every part of me says "go ahead"
i got my hopes up again oh no not again
feels like we only go backwards darling
man beyonce i'm mad at you man


they say hello  hello 
i can daydream about beyonce all day
thinking bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know they say hello  hello 
i really thought i had a chance to be your man
till i seen the video with the ring on your hand
it hurt me so


i remember you were sixteen on the tv screen with wyclef
were you my type oh god yes i was impressed
you was like 'no no no' i was like twelve years old
hoping that one day i could chaperone while you're on the road
you wore braids with a banging body
looked like you did pilates a lot of sit ups probably
but bump that i was there from the start
even when letoya luckett and that other doo doo bucket broke your heart
hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so so
they couldn't sing anyway you deserved to go solo
no disrespect to kelly and michelle i'm just saying
they cool but you you something like wonder woman
and i just want to hold your hand bring you to compton
gonzales park we can build castles in the sand
eating hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
put that napkin down you know i'll lick your fingers when you're finished




i just bought the sasha fierce cd
i gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
she's jealous of you b cause i don't love her like i love you
i even make her do the "uh oh uh oh oh no no" just like you do
she tell me i'm obsessed i tell her we connect
like ice cube way before the mack 10 feud
she like you goddamn fool that girl's rich and you're broke
i said so i'm five hundred mill' away there's still hope
anyway i had feelings way before you got paid
and i didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
and i salute kanye for taking up for you
i would have stole the award just to prove that i love you
but jay shoulda did that i thought he had your bizzack
what happened mr izzo hopico with frederico
he used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
now i tell everybody nas had killed him on 'ether'


they say hello  hello 
i can daydream about beyonce all day
thinking bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know they say hello  hello 
hopefully i still have a chance
maybe if i sabotage your man
you never know hmm


i'ma sneak backstage at a mary j blige concert
with an 'i love mary' shirt then find jay z
and push him into a dancer hopefully they lock lips
that's when i yell out sounwave hurry up take the pic
put it on bossip the same night yeah that sound quite right
publicity like that yep they'd be sure to fight
better yet i'ma steal his cell then call up affion
he impersonates jay well get beyonce on the line
then make up some bogus shit
like you don't the back of my knees right so this marriage is over with
and the ring that's on my finger guess what i'm throwing it 
you heard the sound so you know i did
ha hahhh that should get him
i should break 'em up like a kit kat when i do that yeah true that
i'ma put the plot in motion that's for sure
but if i end up with macy gray this plan never worked

yeeeea man i hope jay don't be mad at me bout this song
start  ay wizzle start me back from like the first verse
like right before i come in
haha what you say nah you think it'll be hot for real though
nigga you stupid they probably laughing as hard as you

you never liked us anyway fuck your friendship i meant it
i'm african american
i'm african i'm black as the moon heritage of a small village pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
you hate me don't you you hate my people
your plan is to terminate my culture you're fuckin evil
i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin my feelings   i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community makin a killin
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga


the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the bigger i shoot


i said they treat me like a slave cah' me black
woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah' we black
and man a say they put me in a chain cah' we black
imagine now big gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars 'pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
all dem a say we doomed from the start cah' we black
remember this every race start from the black
just remember that


i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're tellin me penitentiary would only hire me
curse me 'til i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesizin that i'ma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me don't you i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin me as i pull up fill up my tank then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups show you what these big wheels 'bout
ah black and successful this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch how can i help you
how can i tell you i'm makin a killin
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga






i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me it's generational hatred
it's genocism it's grimy little justification
i'm african american
i'm african i'm black as the heart of a fuckin aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius excuse my french
but fuck you no fuck y'all that's as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me don't you you hate my people
i can tell cause it's threats when i see you i can tell cause your way's deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with that desert eagle
thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin with pirus only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state "marcus garvey got all the answers"
or try to celebrate february like it's my b day
or eat watermelon chicken and kool aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me

"want to lose weight well keep eating"

"in my financial situation"
"heeey what's up doc"


now i was raised in a sandbox next to you and her
you was holding a handgun she was giving birth
to a baby boy to be just like you i i wonder what that's worth
i i wonder if you you ever knew you was a role model to me first
the next day i i woke up in the morning seen you on the news
looked in the mirror then realized that i i i had something to prove
you told me "don't be like me just finish watching cartoons"
which is funny now cause all i see is wile e coyotes in the room

  
and i run it "blow blow blow blow" and i run it "blow blow blow blow"
and i run it "yeah blow" and i run it "yeah blow"
that's ironic "blow blow blow blow" i run it "blow blow blow blow"
that's ironic "yeah yeah blow" i run it "yeah blow yeah"

and i run it "blow blow blow blow" and i run it "blow blow blow blow"
and i run it "yeah yeah blow" and i run it "yeah blow"

"in my financial situation"
"with the liberation his leader"
"popular pie plant pictured here"
"wile e coyote wile e coyote"

   
this shit make a nigga just wanna write
reminisce when i had the morning appetite
apple jacks and after that i hit the tv guide
animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
i'm maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
tell a story that i'll never glory twenty five
not to worry every warrior will come and see euphoria
that's a covenant i put on every tribe
ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
nobody gon' abide by your rule
nobody holding your gun
how come your tongue say killer then kill my mood
light speed living in the world you know
little old me feeling like a live wire
bet i put some new tires on a lightning bolt
till i wreck into a pole/poll like a right to vote
i am from the bottom of the jungle
living in the bottom of the food chain
when you get a new chain nigga take it from you
a new name want stripes and you a zebra lookalike
hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
things we will never learn soon
in the era where we wanna earn soon that's an error
you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
that's why i'm backdooring you muh'fuckers all y'all can suck my dick
all them days at the county building now i'm bout to make my momma rich
cartoons and  i ain't felt this 
scrooge mcduck  elementary hood shit





   
this shit make a nigga just wanna shit
on everybody even with a pot to piss in

dismiss any business of yours
discounts never did amount to a check
that ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounced
everything dismounts niggas gon' flip that car
aks for the whole hood
house lick went down perfect
two shots to the head he deserved it
overheard it in my bed with a bowl and remote control
darkwing duck lost service
momma said i better duck she's nervous
drama all up in the cut hit the curtains
i mean don't intervene with no gun machine
this block stay jerking the feds stay lurking
emerging on everybody corner 
get a toe tag when you play tag with the task of a new 
everybody wanna know my life how did i make it 
well let me tell you like this i've been running this shit since i

i did wrong karma came
crackers gave me ball and chain
friends enemies all the same
state fed both can hang
nobody can mute me
but i never said nobody can't shoot me
just another stat to the white folks
still whip work to the white yolk absolutely
every day feel like the one before
hunt the money don't hunt the hoe
if you do what you always done
then you get what you always got you dumb buffoons
i ain't seen the back of my eyelids
for bout the past seventy two hours
hand on my heart face to the hood
i'll pledge every word you ever heard was honest
yeah this me no mic
no cameras no lights
just pain
momma how much trauma can i sustain
dirty money come with lots of stains
road to riches come with lots of lanes
just another player with lots of game
never had shit got lots to gain
just another player with lots of game
never had shit got lots to gain

"to be continued"
his eyes bloodshot red
i watched him as he took a fifth of henny to the head in memory of his brother
reminiscing on them playing sega with each other
he was hurting i could see it plenty tears no kleenex
i stood by his side because that was my homie
gave him a hug some of his brother blood got on me
clenching his fists on some angry shit
stood up sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with
i wasn't sure so i gave him no answer
but i was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
revenge what do say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet
i tried my best to make him renege but he was like my nig'
this feeling is more than personal
i stood down he hopped in a four door honda accord
before he bent the block he said k dot you wouldn't understand


these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me or war
 the city pressure
the ak 47 twin mac 11s
the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons
pray for me or war


corners become monuments for the dead
candles on the pavement postcard read
rest in peace the yellow tape blocking off the streets
a baby momma yelling at the police
but you don't understand you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas
but the picture is a story untold
see this wasn't in our plans
babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy we was raised that way
put that malcolm x book down then raised that k
complete chaos when we off x pills and st ides
look the devil in the face from a saint eye
cast a 'spell' on you like akeelah and the bee
every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
substance time is no longer an issue
we don't have it so pass the tissue
then close the casket kiss the momma when you can
then tell her you understand but you don't understand


these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me or war
 the city pressure
the ak 47 twin mac 11s
the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons
pray for me or war


he came back fifteen minutes later
he said dot i went on one do me this favor
dump these guns in a safe place let nobody see you
this is critical as it gets my nigga i need you
i said alright so what happened seen a few niggas slipping
and i just started clapping i didn't care who i was hitting
that's wild shit but anyway i got you
i love you my nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
i woke up the next morning with a cold
allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking
checked the medicine cabinet looking for some dayquil
but all i seem was some aspirins just my luck
i got up went to rite aid
hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid i bought it and left
walked to the parking lot that's when i seen the faces of death
said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand
praying that it would jam but you don't understand


these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me or war
 the city pressure
the ak 47 twin mac 11s 
the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons 
pray for me or war


it's like it's a revolving door
that i've been a part of my whole life

back with a vengeance
back with my heart and i'm venting
back with another war pendant salute me or shoot me
i never wore a kufi ignored my religion
i believe there's one god there's one love
and i believe if i fly we all doves
i make a way for my people to see the light
brighter than yellow bones me and my microphone could be one
until i see big 'pac see pun but this ain't eazy
i can't take a big l my city needs me
i gotta win the proof is in the pudding
and i've been fucking with cosby since i was ten you damn right
any means necessary get the campaign right
very emotional i'm a gemini
i love hard and i fight harder a born author
a born starter in the game for real
and the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
you can't learn if mistakes ain't made
you gotta pay homage in order to get paid
you gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't getting it till you start paying jewels
lifestyles of the young and the broke
with my hand under oath i recite these quotes
and if i ever lied then i'd die where i stand
as a pest not a man with a roach and a rat
in order to see the front had to play the back
we played our position we let y'all play yourself
y'all made your decision we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of corinthians
i see stars when i write these sentences
words crash cars when i write these sentences
open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
free j dub kill all witnesses
y'all better hope 2012 really real
cause the way i feel i'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
i haven't ate in the last twenty two summers and i'm twenty two now
it's about to go down so en garde my god
we got these artists in awe
oh i'm free
finally i can say i'm me
the kendrick lamar ep a classic ep
the question concerned
i dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
hope y'all infected hope y'all didn't have no protection
still i'm progressing room for improvement
make room for the groom married to his music
i was at the xxl just trying to excel
networking meanwhile my stomach turning
wanted to be a part of it catering to my audience
j cole running late if he don't show up
think i can take his place ladies start laughing
no pun intended i ain't being sarcastic
homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh off the plane i couldn't even complain
my nigga was on his hustle i introduced him my name
said i'll see him on the bubble in the future
my dude i salute ya contributing to real shit
talk about it make the people talk about it make the world see
for every emcee that i see tryna steal flow
tell 'em build a boat like noah
and take 'em to a place that i'm sure we all can blow up boom
i ain't a star yet but i'm getting close to 'em
and if you see a wack artist do more than boo him
throw him off the banister shoot him on camera
then kill his manager than hang a banner up
that reads you can't proceed without being conceived
by one album of the nineties
on rosecrans where you'll find me
and all my niggas is grimy but i remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where i'm from where you live
oh no we've got to slow the city down
i told the homeboy pump his brakes
he said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
sawed off torture
turn the saw off scorching
hot where i'm from the newscasters don't come
another ratchet got dumped in the trash can
i ain't done a baby in there with it
she said postpartum did it
molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing said he'll only be a minute
that's why a nigga always kicking something with some feeling
i should have been a dentist i should have been a blizzard cold
flash pose flash pose
a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
i wanna jump on 'em like a tadpole
tadpole assholes
tryna kill my dreams not elevate
those are not my dreams i'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a drive like an aston
motivation from nipsey or glasses jay rock
mykestro bad lucc u n i
dom kennedy murs and fashawn
lady g willie b in time
i'ma blow like a motherfucker sniffing lines
go like i've never seen a red light shine
flow till my heart hit the flo' when i'm dying
heart of a lion tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton i won't pass it back
i ain't good at dimes
if the bitch bad i could pass you a dime
haters better duck like i'm passing a pine
know i'm the king and i'm passing you pawns
pad of the hill that's a passion of mine
promise i shine
like two mics under heavy strobe lights
i'ma need to mics just to get my point across
i'ma get my joint across country y'all gon' want me~
one two one two one two 
a one two one two one two
one two 
one two; you mix with dre right 
turn the headphones up

when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
that's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
find the tallest building in vegas and jump off it
but i could never rewrite history in a coffin
so i'm talkin' to god "can you wash all these demons off me"
this last year i've been quite similar to aaliyah
control my own destiny only rapper that steered
a g5 g's give high fives to me and say "kendrick just persevere"
the presence of being real
as i lay in this four corner room staring at candles
thinkin' "how can i make an example
for this generation of compton" my biggest fear is not feeling accomplished 
or turnin' back to that same accomplice
my past life was a child with no act right
tryin' to smile in a room of killers turn into a crash site
influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
assurin' that some blossom early and some truant
thank god for the album i idolized
it's dark and plus hell is hot that's the start of this crazy ride
two young niggas me and dave inside the garage
and thought we was jay and dame that's the lane that we tried to drive
truthfully i just started rappin' to get away
i never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
my nigga got hit 25 times with a k
make the decision ride the beat or ride in a hearse
now punch is my mentor top dawg is the coach
jay rock is my older brother i was there when he wrote
his name on his record deal we had figured the coast
would live on a pedestal once the shit hit the store
found ourselves scramblin' tryna figure it out
soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch
we eatin' off each other tray the dollar menu amount
meanwhile the coast goin' hard at each other
the younger rappers had wanted some of the ogs' comfort but i ain't need it
i never screamed out the "new west" i didn't believe it
they brought each other down i was plannin' out my achievements hahahah
i need to separate myself to stand out tahah
i need a better way to take your fans now hahah
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead 
three hollow tips aimed at your head i'll be damned if the chopper jammed now 
and we never asked for no hand out
in the midst of it all i recall a call when you said how
we could never resolve in the hall of fame
and i'm with the trial with a bible and a rifle i play the game as i plan blow~
hollaback at me nigga
and if they said that i'm the one why you askin' me nigga
cause when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
enough pressure to make you just open the book of david
and pray to god that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
cause fallin' off is a sickness i heard that it's quite contagious
i need to separate myself to stand out tahah
i need a better way to take your fans now hahah
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head


i'll be damned if the chopper jam now~
and we never asked for no hand out
i'll take you back to that pack of black & milds in my hand now 
in the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
lookin' forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
fast forward as i wait in line for this passport
the homies was still poor was workin' at jansport


uh whoever thought that rosenberg would mention me to dre
even vanessa from double xl had told him to press play
and there goes my fate now i'm on stage with snoop
gave me the torch and i ran with it in high pursuit
rapped with my forefathers even record with gaga too
lyricist of the year fuck am i supposed to do rock


laughin' at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
thought i was aggravated when warner had let me loose
i was honest see they was haunted when mike jones didn't recoup


cool cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
even when my album leak fans still buy it for proof
i came i saw i conquered
no shame i blame all of this on compton
thinkin' about when sherane tried to set me up
cold game full circle they set up her
i put my life in these twelve songs my fight in these twelve songs
the fight to ignite any wrong or right that i prolong
the story was short film the glory of him and them
the worry of mothers that don't recover when babies killed
the trial and the tribulations the newer miseducation
the view of a body wastin' you knew somebody who ain't make it
the angry the adolescent the reason i ask this question
will you let hip hop die on october 22nd

will you let hip hop die on october 22nd
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you


thirty millions later my future favors
the legendary status of a hip hop rhyme savior
travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship candy coated my day shift's
been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
pi equals three fourteen
the devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing wait up
lampin' in jamaica the clouds turnin' my thoughts turnin'
burnin' castor oil i been determined to make an earnin'
this seed in this soil is classified
i'm satisfied when i strategize my kid's future
i ain't sanctified enough to say that i won't shoot ya
i done vandalized the industry full circuit
the earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
scum of a land that transcend two surfaces the richer the poorer
the bigger the picture the more blood pours but




my fans can't wait for me to son ya punk ass and crush ya whole lil' shit
i'll big pun ya punk ass you a scared lil' bitch
tiptoein' around my name nigga you lame
and when i get at you homie don't you just tell me you was just playin'

oh you don't wanna clash nigga i know
i put my foot on the gas head on the floor
hoppin' out before the vehicle crash i'm on a roll
yellin' "one two three four five
i am the greatest rapper alive"
so damn great motherfucker i've died
what you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
house on the hill house on the beach nigga 
a condo in compton i'm still in reach nigga 
i'm fresh out the water i'm 'bout to breach nigga
the five foot giant woke up out of his sleep nigga
oh yeah oh yeah mo' cars mo' lears mo' bars no peers

earthed in ditches your body revertin' to stiffness
the whole world gone mad

niggas is fake rich bitches is fake bad
blacks that act white whites that do the dab
donald trump is a chump know how we feel punk tell 'em that god comin'
and russia need a replay button y'all up to somethin'
electorial votes look like memorial votes

so that means no more playin' the back scenes 
my spot is solidified if you ask me 
my name is identified as "that king"

september 22nd 2009
kendrick lamar to to

let me start off this letter saying i don't like you
scared of you but i will fight you
i stare at the ceiling and think about you
curiosity killing me thinking of when i'ma meet you
you introduced yourself to so many others mothers sisters and brothers
children and babies drive me crazy i wonder
why you love people that love people that do right
is it rocket science to you or is it just your type
one of my biggest fears
is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
or maybe a person that i'll never meet cause of you
you son of a bitch and i wish you never existed
and i swear i'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
but that's not realistic cause you'll never write
but i'ma still send this letter off po box
and when you get it


please take it personal
please take it personal
please take it personal
because it's personal


let me continue this letter saying i don't like you
i'm scared of you but i will fight you
should be ashamed of the moves you make
the pain you bring the sorrow and the hearts you break
every day you remind me that you're always there
cause every time i come around someone's getting shot down
and all i say is a prayer so help me lord
then the lord talk back i can't help you boy
that's fucked up my luck's fucked was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up i gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting dwelling upon the masses
of the earth fatal assassins snatch your bodies
probably on my notepad as i write
why the fuck you wanna take my life
sooner or later i'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
so when i write on this paper it's real talk so



 *screwed vocals*
let me start off this letter saying i don't like you too
and the reason why we haven't met because i've been busy dude
but ever since grade school i watched your every move
you slipped up a few times
i gave you a pass so don't say i ain't sympathetic
but you can bet it your curiosity i'ma dead it
everybody wanna know why i act this way
let's just say i had a bad day
matter of fact everyday gotta take it out on somebody
and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
i was born to be a killjoy i'm a old brat
conceived by adam and eve so who you mad at
not me see me i'm just doing my job
and you ducking me is mos def an odd
so why send this letter as if i never knew you
i'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you


it's everywhere the streets the corners
the coroners the morgues
cemeteries hospitals
heard about 'em when i was little
tomorrow's not promised
cause any day he can be knocking at your front door
war genocide homicide
suicide all coincide
signed and sealed by the living
make it don't take it


"we got a young brother that stands for something
 we got a young brother that believes in all of us
 brother kendrick lamar he's not a rapper he's a writer
 he's an author and if you read between the lines
 we'll learn how to love one another but you can't do that
 i said you can't do that without loving yourself fir "




i done been through a whole lot
trials tribulations but i know god
satan wanna put me in a bowtie
pray that the holy water don't go dry yea yay
as i look around me
so many motherfuckers wanna down me
but ain't no nigga gon' never drown me
in front of a dirty double mirror they found me and


i love myself

i love myself

i love myself

i love myself



everybody lookin at you crazy 
what you gon' do 
lift up yo' head and keep movin
or let the paranoia haunt you
peace to fashion police i wear my heart
on my sleeve let the runway start
you know the miserable do love company
what do you want from me and my scars
everybody lack confidence everybody lack confidence
how many times our potential was anonymous
how many times the city makin me promises
so i promise this




they wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
and a gun in the hood and a mob of police
in iraq on the corner in a line full of fiends
and a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
yep these days are frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
i duck these cold faces post up fe fi fo fum basis
dreams are reality's peace 
blow steam in the face of the beast
the sky can fall down the wind can cry now
the stronger me'll still smile




walk   my   bare   feet 
down   down   valley   deep  
fe   fi   fo   fum  
my   heart   un   done 




i went to war last night
with an automatic weapon don't nobody call a medic
i'ma do it 'til i get it right
i went to war last night
i've been dealin with depression ever since an adolescent
duckin every other blessings i can never see the message
i can never take the lead i can never bob and weave
for my nigga they be lettin 'em annihilate me
and the sounds that i'm movin in at meteor speed
finna run into a building let my body in the streets
keep my money in the ceiling let my momma know i'm free
give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
and a glory to the feeling of the audience scenes
send 'em up make a motherfucker scream   i love myself~


i lost my head i must misread what the good book said
oh woes be me it's a jungle inside
give myself again 'til the well runs dry i
i can tell you what it is i can tell you what it isn't
no more k dot my mother had named me kendrick
fuck a stage name that's the name that i was given
the only thing that i can identify within this bidness
i'm just a good kid from compton that want to rap
weighing my options pick up a bible or a strap
i never killed a man never sold any crack
all i ever did was try to keep my city on the map
but this monkey on my back y'all don't want me to win
i'm tryna follow dreams you want me to follow trends
so just to get a dollar will i sell my soul
i look the devil in the eye and tell him hell no
they say anything worth having is worth the wait
well i want the world tell me how long that takes
there's no time like now i can cut my patience/patients short
or give 'em some more gowns i don't even want the crown
i just want a peace of mind and nigga when i get it
you won't get a piece of mine won't you mind your own bidness
a rich nigga buy anything you sell him
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
well i'm a broke nigga
but still i wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a bible quote nigga
pfttuh

see i was brought up different
whatever that my pops said for sure i'd listen
you said you did dirt but i can't dig it
it don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
oh no oh oh
i swear we got to fast forward

before time flies by
my new sound for '0 10 is why lie
and if you ain't trying to win then why try
now you can low ball or give me high five
this is i nigga look into my eye

nigga my name is kendrick lamar
i said my name is kendrick lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are pfttuh

and that used to be a hell of a task
now i'm ahead of my class so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a
confidence that can marry a halle berry or angelina with no cash
i'm bout to cash in my thoughts
give you a compass then tell you get lost
what i'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
once the 'eves' come they quick to stare 'adam'/at him
hoping i don't take they bitch but i'm on some other shit
when i'm done i'm tryna run the government
they are big dreams
transition from a rapper to a human being you can't 'school' a dean

colors corresponding to gangs upon us
common corrupted crip and pirus cripple the city
triple the crime bible nor the qur'an can save
welcome don't be afraid your city similar right
where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
stare at the sky wonder will you live to see twenty five
i'm twenty two at twenty i knew i was against the odds
this kid named jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister his older cousin he honored him
anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
to johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again he see the lifestyle of an active member
pull out a mac 11 now his eyes is big
fascinated by mayhem what's his cousin to say now
he wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree took 'em under his wings like kfc
crip crazy rocking matching t shirts that says "the hood made me"
no love just spread slugs that's the policy the leader and the prodigy
now shorty doo wop holding a oowop hanging with rah rahs
with blah blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
going on missions with lunatics a ninth grade menace
thugging for six months smoking like six blunts an hour
the power of banging he was walking from 
little johnny

  
"i think you'll find sir that there will come a time
 when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
 and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
 and then at that point you'll have a situation
 where when you attack one black man you are attacking all black men
 and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
 and this type of thinking also will bring an end
 to the brutality inflicted upon black people by 
 and it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
 no federal court state court or city court will bring an end to it
 it's something that the black man has to bring an end to"
uh shoutout to schoolboy q
he uglier than a motherfucker 

tire marks tire marks finish line with the tire marks
when the relay starts i'm a runaway slave uhh
walking on water and running on waves god mc
oh my god you gotta see there's never no is in me
of an odyssey i'm a block away
fire marshals moving in marshmallows inside my pen
sweet sixteens got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
i'm so appalled with a prototype with a guy named protocol
you an amateur they want a pro' to call
i'll damage on camera in compton in canada i don't care where ya are
just blink twice and i'm there where ya are
like a shadow in the dark you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
water in the pot throw crack rock
like bam bam nigga have two grams nigga
pay up or blam blam nigga have the black cam'
we can go dipset killa cam nigga
i've been around niggas killers pimps
you ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
jumped off the porch when i was like six
uncle bobby got the house raided back in '9 6
kick in the do'
canines was all in the kitchen way before i even heard of mike vick
momma in the bathroom poppa at work
happened on a sunday we should have went to church
look at my shirt polo on it
it's gon' sell if my logo on it
i fear no opponent
a demon come near and i might throw a spear at the omen
you looking at the twenty ten romans' empire
hiiipower hp in ya face like hd
and i spit like an hk i'ma shot like an h3
h u b c i t y ab and yg
problem and hootie nigga
tell the government come shoot me nigga
cause i'm going out with a fist raised
and a fistful of money give it to the fifth grade
drink a fifth of hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from ca
they don't wanna see a b l a c k
making some scratch like a hall of fame dj
give us some free js put us in the pjs
now we in the county jail calling for a three way
goddamn your call
marketing base where your goddamn barcode
stuck in the street was dark like harpo
black man tell me where your goddamn heart go
although i'm in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit
when i got my first chain all them niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit get it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny
tryna talk back and shit like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i'm being myself my b f f is a b m w
with your b m in it and a stash box glove
and the medicine the doctor gave a nigga won't help
i'm at a limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i'm better anywhere every rapper get killed
like bla bla bla bla~ where the knife at
cut cut cut where your life at
career's over he's slumped over
and if i'm off beat know i'm un sober
that's a new flow

plus plus q gave me some kush and some nuvo
new dough for the new year
and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper i'm a raptor
that's a t rex in a v neck for the rapture
i'm a factor in your facial
i'm a fracture to a fraction
of one half and i hate math
pastor's like eddie long fucking maricone
took me mighty long to get here nigga fuck~

told ya i was gonna fall off q
we recording you got that shit
 ugly our ugly ass 

don't woooorry~
as my mind drifts and then split like the middle of a spliff
i begin to catapult off the cliff
of the unknown i've got a feeling in my funny bone
that we're not the same just antonyms of another age
my soul flock with the carefree words of the wise
i spoke a hundred times like a gold d
ha ha l m f a o
i hate y'all but i spread love like mayo then spread slugs
my brain matter is a brain fatter
see my vision or my vision will stare at ya
this is the future if i say so you copping fitted caps
i'm bout to go and cop a halo the god of rap
and i mean it i play football with mars
and marbles with pluto and venus witness the genius
i interact with the inner city villains
that will enter your system like a computer hack then give you dap
mic check ali
the mic don't sound right


even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot 
even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot


uhh tell 'em i got plenty arson to sell 'em
heat by the fleet displaying it very seldom 
ly i write till i ignite my cerebellum
close to the pen like i had three felons
come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another homi' taking it's course
of course my dream was to play in the final four
till twelfth grade came and i was only five four
so now i'm a graduate looking to get hired
my pops knew a security job he inquired
but ignorance is bliss that's what i was told
i stopped dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable
to run into a lot of crime i wrote it in my rhymes
and when i left the porch this is what i realised

  
even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot 
even the shooters can get shot get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot 



so i'm thinking to myself what's next
my security job only got me like two checks
my pops disappointed told me i'm fucking up
irresponsible and i needed some growing up
i told him i would go back knowing i wouldn't go back
working a nine to five is something i couldn't stomach
surrounded by the violence all the goons and the goblins
with ninety nine problems i still kept it one hundred
these streets can be rather manipulating
especially when you're black and just turned eighteen
so what's a kid to do when you're fresh out of school
and the negatives of the world constantly following you
not to mention a local henchman compton sheriffs all like terrorists
osama with badges that talk arrogant
that boy fifteen fifteen and he holding a 45
thirty years apart thirty years before he realised




uhh soon as the beat drop
i bet some heat pop on a block close to you
like a relative you sipping belvedere
while these niggas planning to rob mr belvedere yeah
i'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as martin luther
but it seems like all my friends eventually become shooters
and niggas banking on you is something that you'll get used to
you can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
whatever you do just make sure that you willing to do it
being too indecisive can get you killed inside your buick
cause you stopped at the light five minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
you tell me you listening but you don't hear the music
call you billy hoyle when turmoil was near
this is the realest right here when i lost my very first job
my pops said "why" i said i couldn't aim for the sky
cause even shooters can get shot get shot


these streets ain't none to play with
it could get outrageous
got burners 45s and gauges
that could really get outrageous
my back against the wall i can see y'all fronting
drowning in your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing
i call this shit "rapper shit" cause i ain't a rapper
but if i was this ain't some shit that i could rap after
caught up in the rapture you call yourself a factor
you're lame paving away bob could build faster
i'm a real master real massive you just real average
i see your chain it's strange they wore those in the middle passage
and it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards
don't act like you knew my tactics
cause when it hits the fan you know i stand last
i see through your true colors like stained glass
i see the fear in your eyes when we arrive
and what's the odds of even thinking you coincide
when every time a nigga open a door you go inside
just to realize either you're weak or someone lied
see you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do
so by the time your shit is due it's doo doo
and who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back
would slip through the crack like dudes who went to rehab
ab soul abstract asshole
black lip bastard et cetera for forever
i follow no ruler even if i'm under a drastic measure
but whatever


they say pressure bust pipes
and i ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life now that's a bar
sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
you would test me but you know better
it's inadequate to go against the jesus of nazareth
of the rap game and guess what i got no cheddar
but my mind is like a wizard
i define the laws of gravity every time i get high and write a sentence
back teeth never been in agony but i got wisdom
i have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition scorch ya
third degree burns next to their sideburns all sorts of
combustable flows firemen on speed dial
free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
free the teachers black activists get up off your feet now
and feed off my feelings as i control my wheel
like new power steering so sincere
tryna duck court hearings but i got big ears
rap peers used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
now they can't fuck with him i'm wishing good luck to them
reluctantly these critics loving me and i don't blame 'em
they say kendrick you gunning for these niggas
so when i pull my weapon out i give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
and watch these bullets run into these niggas clear the set
i got now i got next give you nouns give you verbs
give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
i am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
big homie fear young buck cause when i buck i make more than a buck
dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
put me in alaska for six months in the dark in my heart i know sun/son still shine
still got a skill to be found in a gold mine


i got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic
who with pliers couldn't get a grip on life
i spit like i sat the tip of my dick on ice and that's intense
imagine if i had already came twice ain't that some shit
pass the swisher nigga fill your cup with liquor nigga
fly your kite till you're gone till november nigga
show 'em you remember nigga
pour some hennessy and crown for your homie six feet underground
smoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down
like the triangle in the panties of my gal
when mike jack made "raining in moscow" i had no style
tommy boy stocking on my scalp
and that was like ninety five now it's twenty ten
two years away from when they say the world's expected to end
and i ain't even begin
that's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 cent from "many men" one


too many relays for djs to replay
i do the reject while i eject your new singlay
hot enough to sit in hell then unveil in heatwave
piss on a demon with ice water
and if i lose my voice then i'm probably calling out to all pa
systems to assist in with the word i'm tryna spread
like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
and that's off top like a toupee i'm 2pac
coming back for doomsday spitting at cops go and cop my album
get high to it pop some valium then turn up the volume
i influence ghettos where it says caution
and them larkins get to sparking like la females that's balling
round the time this happens often the violence get the flare
we racing against life the turtle or the hare
and nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
y'all work at build a bear's office underhand pitching with skills


shit and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk
you're dead and gone
the pall bearers carry you and your family will carry on
and on the real this ain't a construction site but you know the drill
we lead the league in all aspects
and we deserve more medals/metals than a magnet
put you niggas in a hole like bad debt
shooting three pointers with the globe nothing but nets


nigga nothing but the best
every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
i rhyme like a fucking tec
 9 and i 'clown posses' if they disrespect
you looking at t rex snapping at 'em with tourette's
yeah this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
too late i grab the eight and start expiring rappers
some shit only big and pac could rap after
and if they was alive they would have to pay tithes
i am god
mcr squares will disperse in despair this is me motherfucker
rare breed kendrick lamar
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up

this is for my niggas that be all blacked out
hit the streets a hundred deep what rare breed about
riding hard bending corners the girlies on us
leave a hater scarred big dressers sit at the stop light
road glides and road kings deep in my hindsight
you do it right or don't do it at all
put that candy paint on it ride them twenty threes homie
custom seats custom brakes hit the streets and ball
centre of attention like bynum and gasol aw
you know that killer californication
when you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling chasing
dreams hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
it's abomination how we bomb yo' block
i'm talking big punch k dub baby slip billy
bad azz rare breed we all we got
see 'em out show 'em love chunk the deuce give it up
it's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard nope


pounding on the highway stretch
all blacked out making sure we on deck
might catch us on them dressers or them road glides yes
tell the world i'm a rare breed baby
breed up or speed up 
breed up or speed up 
breed up or speed up i'm a rare breed baby


and it's like that to the death though
two oh point and seeing decimals i ain't lying
pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
or we might be in a hood near you
around the globe baby rare breed under control baby
them pipes loud the movement entice crowds
we heat it up in the cold baby
it's three degrees out then you should see me out
or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
ha ha we be the father of harley drivers so don't bother
show you infants how to whip it have a bye bye
posers try to hang then we hang 'em by the collar
silk lannie rare breed family
stunting hard like a black circus voila
breed up or speed up get ahead
so with that said bye bye




shouting out the one and only rare breed
now breed up
reporting live compton california
the good kid

i'm tired of doing it
the same way gotta flip it before i ruin it
make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
opinions get thrown out the window with ron browz
so turn me up loud so the world can hear
and when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death go death i said
go death and stay dead a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
but i ain't here for no ignorance
i'm militant as martin luther king and a penalty
aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
i've got in it my genes you probably think i'm talking bout a pistol
but i'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
my nigga what you worry for i ain't tryna jock your swag
i'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant yeah


as time flies hope that i'm soaring
far from the boring i'ma
tell you why it's important
i'm not the boring i'ma
if i think and act like you do
the world will die from not seeing something new
and if i don't speak on how i feel
the world will lose out on what's really real
and if i should die before i wake
i pray my music could take my place
in the world the relevant


i'd rather you call me that
than a typical artist you call wack
on a youtube blog holding ars and stacks
of ones but never could be the one
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
passion is too strong i'm pissed off
so there's a chance you get pissed on r kelly was in the wrong
but that don't make you an exempt
that don't make you a no go from hitting the fence
you ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
the crowd yell "hoe" but i ain't a pimp
i'm me i'm free as a five finger discount
see you on the flip side right after i dismount
if i ever feel like i ain't pushing myself
i'll find a cliff then push myself off the edge
like a barber at the tip of your head
that's how i settle it life or death if i ain't relevant nigga




so feel free to not mind me
if you're used to boosters drug dealers and shooters on wax
cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
i could easily cheat and let the four four play like a two on two orgy
but i've been there and it bores me
got to the point where it did nothing for me
at forty i want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
and i'm mad young so i'd rather do it now before my career's done
this is pain plus glory victory is here
if i cried you could see strength and pride in my tears
i do it for the kids
i do it for the twenty three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen
and my pen is the only thing i got for hip hop to change the game
and they'll remember my name as the relevant


"this this this should be played at high volume
 preferably in a residential"


life's a bitch life's a bitch
but i'ma keep the pussy wet yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet yep

and i think that i'm richard pryor with priors of thirty two fiends
and that means that i here fly higher tell me why are you staring at me
matter of fact man your eyes is wired you inspired by kendrick the king
maybe it's cause i'm living my dream man i sing what i'm living about
in the words that come out of my mouth they requires a random routine
of being organic granite then my access is granted
to represent the shit that i conceive and i guarantee that i'ma bring
my mind body and soul and i sold all these records off being myself
and i wish you can do the same thing man it's easier than a stripper
or tying a baby shoestring you stringing along
and really why you writing a song your passion for music is never in sync
no secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
and they tell me life is a bitch who gives a shit you can believe


i'ma keep the pussy wet yep
i'ma keep the pussy wet yep
my dick hard her pussy wet
i'ma keep the pussy wet yep
 i came  i went
 i came  i went

and i see that you envy of me enemy ghosts don't prosper
better yet they do die eventually if i'm at the event you will leave
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you but i don't hear you can you hear this breathe
with an oxygen mask and the masses keep saying i'm speaking for them
and if you can imagine my madness then you can see where i've been
and the places the louis has been and i swear i've been doing this when
you was in pajamas watching b b barney and and friends
and you couldn't harm me even with ten weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks you shot blanks and i shot back made your duplex bend
what the fuck you think if i don't think then i'm right back where the city sin
what the fuck you drink thinking i can't write these raps in the lions' den
when i hear that you lying then it's murder she wrote ain't no hope
you go downhill man where's your slope get thrown downhill tied to a rope
tell the world to put intervals man i swear this the antidote
and they tell me that life is a bitch who gives a shit when you know that




and i see that you envy of me
don't prosper better yet they do die eventually
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you
hi hoe bye hoe
pour up  head shot 
sit down  stand up 
pass out  wake up 
faded  faded 


now i done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
i was in a dark room loud tunes looking to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up filling up my cup i see the crowd move
changing by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me


nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
pool full of liquor then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
pool full of liquor i'ma dive in it
pour up  head shot 
sit down  stand up 
pass out  wake up 
faded  faded 


"ok now open your mind up and listen me kendrick
 i am your conscience if you do not hear me then you will be history kendrick
 i know that you're nauseous right now and i'm hoping to lead you to victory kendrick"
if i take another one down i'ma drown in some poison abusing my limit
i think that i'm feeling the vibe i see the love in her eyes
i see the feeling the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
this how you capitalize this is parental advice then apparently
i'm over influenced by what you are doing i thought i was doing the most then someone said to me



   
i ride you ride bang
one chopper one hundred shots bang
hop out do you bang
two chopper two hundred shots bang


me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota
a quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda
janky stash box when the federales will roll up
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor
we on the mission for bad bitches in trouble
i hope the universe love you today
cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill their body with hate if it's necessary
bumping jeezy' first album looking distracted
speaking language only we know you think it's an accent
the windows roll down all i see is a hand pass it
hot boxing like george foreman grilling the masses
of the working world we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with look at me
i got the blunt in my mouth usually i'm drug free
but shit i'm with the homies


me and the homies

me and the homies

me and the homies


it's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
air conditioner broke and i hear my stomach screaming
hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
i'll tell you to suck my dick then i'll continue eating
we speeding on the 4 0 5 passing westchester
you know the light skinned girls in all their little dresses good lord
they knew we weren't from round there
cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
before we sparked the conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
i never was a gangbanger
i mean i never was stranger to the folk neither i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
that's ironic cause i've never been violent
until i'm with the homies


me and the homies

me and the homies

me and the homies


bragging bout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
i'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up beefing if we ain't got the cd in
but jeezy still playing and our attitude is still nigga what is you saying
pull in front of the house that we've been camping out for like two months
the sun is going down as we take whatever we want
i hit the back window in search of any nintendo
dvds plasma screen tvs in the trunk
we made a right then made a left then made a right
then made a left we was just circling life
my mama called kicking it
i should have told her i'm probably bout to catch my first offense
with the homies



but they made a right then made a left then made a right
then another right
one lucky night with the homies


me and the homies

me and the homies

me and the homies

twisted up in cold heat

hennessy by the two litre fuck a fifth
today i'm feeling like a nigga that worry don't exist
i need some alone time cut off my phone get in the zone
within my own mind i'm gone be back in a minute
cruise till i hit the beach of venice parlay
play the strip like an arcade while bumping some sade
'sweetest taboo' my brain is a castle
built from the hands of god oh god
i'm a free soul staring in the belly of an eagle
that's not a metaphor that's just me hoe
they say i'm an activist rapper
i'm just a regular nigga jigga and pac playing john madden
now picture that while i finish rolling this bubba kush
reading scriptures from the good book
that's not considered a sin is it


as i move
i feel way better doing me i can only do me
i hope that you do you
i think to myself truthfully i can only feel me
some people say that i'm rude
but i don't give a damn if she if he if them
or they say i'm uncool
nothing would change how i feel me today


what i compose be so potent
that if the earth dried i could spit back the ocean
then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting

so if the devil came tell him that i'll be alright
i'm so high off life that i can od

so let me start off the third verse
bigging up y'all favorites as i curse
fuck the system fuck the truth fuck religion
fuck the government fuck the law fuck the prisons
fuck george bush fuck rappers who love dissing

i swear you people don't know kendrick you don't know him

everything inside this human being i'm still growing
i'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
doors on the lamborghini i want 'em
can't afford 'em so i tell the swap meet to clone 'em
i guess i really am a vanity slave
i guess my ancestors turning in they graves
burning money when i get it fuck a life savings
overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
when i put this fashion on i'm a fashion junkie
picking cotton in the country i bought this out the country
whips and chains whips and chains jacob know my name
he call me kunta you my brother we come from the same
modern world that's your girl i see she rocking fendi
try this on if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
copping everything in sight ignoring they sacrifice
amnesia if i see the black visa in my hand tonight
i show my dick and then i swipe that's a punchline
they was hot and i wore ice that's ironic huh

  
word around town that i'm all about the bitches
word around town that i love my twenty sixes
word around town that i gotta stay paid
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave

lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave

lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave 


aw man videos got me wanting hoes
appetite for flashing lights all i can do is pose
a black male on melrose
i should get blackmailed buy my people hell rose
niggas that ain't had shit for four hundred years
overcompensate by over accessorising with gear
many of y'all don't see my vision
i do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
am i a hypocrite cause everyday i'm contradicting
i think of how i'm living then i watch "how i'm livin'"
i know this can't be right my conscience tell me to stay righteous
it's unlikely to see what i like and say i don't like it
biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me
i wanna move accordingly but baby steps are premature remember
i'm flying to the south and i'll be gone till november
to see my family tree but this a shame i'm yelling out timber



  
cold oh so cold
how ironic he bought it then sold his soul
is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll
the remote control is taking control
lift up the doors
that lamborghini i wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogues
i like 'em both i'll wife 'em both
take these motherfucking jordans off put on my loafs
cause nothing goes bad every time i wear 
i'm getting more ass every time i wear 
they tell me it's a fad every time i wear 
but should i give a fuck when it bring me more coochie
this a young nigga's pedigree i pray the lord can better me
if not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
them voices keep on telling me kendrick don't forget about us
i burned my wardrobe hoping that i could live without it


look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
i never felt the feeling of euphoria
pain forever prolonged
the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
wake up in the morning and i gotta win
not taking the victory is my only sin
and so i send a message to your messenger
a warning shot to let 'em know i'm serious
i'm ready for a war when i roar it can break a glass window
the only thing for sure's the perfect way to bend you
on your back even if i gotta slither through the cracks
i can crack every code you deliver i attack
every hole where the bomb squad sit it on a tripod
even if he try hard he can still die hard
run but you can't hide white flags
you can pull 'em out fast and tell me your last goodbye


i will i will climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i got to lose what i got to prove
i guess war is my love


make sure your next move is slick your best move is nothing
you know i take risk darks clouds i love it
cause i can hide in the mist hop out and crushing
every soldier you're wit so i'm six for six
i'm sick with determination i terminate ya quick
i lead the pack i follow no rules
i see the traps i know you're close to
falling on your face unload reload
hand me another case explode explode
the fire in my eyes is waiting on your demise
i know you hope your help is close by

i'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
the serengeti's clone

grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
i got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig charlotte's web is gonna miss you
my issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat because our life's an instrumental
this is physical and mental i won't sugar coat it
you'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
and everything on tv just a figment of imagination
i don't want no plastic nation dread that like a haitian
while you motherfuckers waiting i be off the slave ship
building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs

dear lord come save me the devil's working hard
he probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
frightening so fucking frightening
enough to drive a man insane i need a license
to kill i'm standing on a field full of land mines
doing the moonwalk hoping i blow up in time

i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think i'm a terrorist
eat my asparagus then i'm asking her
thoughts of a young nigga fast money and freedom
a crash dummy for diamonds i know you dying to meet 'em
i'll probably die in a minute
just bury me with twenty bitches twenty million and a comp town fitted


hol' up  hol' up 
hol' up  hol' up 
yeah big shit popping section 80


back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
jump off i call a bitch a bitch
a hoe a hoe a woman a woman i never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that i'm easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
as a kid i killed two adults i'm too advanced
i lived my twenties at two years old the wiser man
truth be told i'm like '87
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
from a distance don't know which one is a christian damn
who can i trust in 2012 there's no one not even myself
a gemini screaming for help somebody


hol' up  hol' up 
hol' up  hol' up 
yeah big shit popping everybody watching
when you do it like this nigga losing ain't an option
hol' up  hol' up 
hol' up  hol' up 
yeah big shit popping

twenty four seven nigga working his ass for it she popping that ass for it
the king of diamonds with diamonds i never do ask for

they want me fast forward the game and why you complain

yeah big shit popping everybody watching
when you do it like this nigga losing ain't an option
hol' up  hol' up

i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think i'm osama
the plane emergency landed it was an honor hol' up
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars


uh and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur that's her favorite rapper
bumping "brenda's got a baby" while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking she start running
like flo jo don't care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
just give all to her daddy but she don't know her father that's ironic
see a block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet




and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide
said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police




and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners' redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
this motherfucker is the fucking reason why keisha rushing
through that block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
then caught a knife inside the bladder left her dead raped in the street
keisha's song

mm my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song sat her down and pressed play


check check check check
it go


ride to it ride to it cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it die to it
die to it die to it live your life live it right
be different do different things don't do it like
he did cause he ain't what you is but we can win
wait let's get straight to the point


to the meaning of life what's my purpose
maybe this earth is ain't a good place to be
how far is heaven let's see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts
i wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me
look at me look at me i'm a loser i'm a winner
i'm good i'm bad i'm a christian i'm a sinner
i'm humble i'm loud i'm righteous i'm a killer
what i'm doing i'm saying that i'm human now people just




it go one two three
two in the front one in the back seat seat
seat seat looking for a victim of an ak 47
hundred round each each each
but why must we retaliate is it human nature
i don't know i look for the answers later
make a right there they go sometimes gotta




as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
i'm dying inside i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom a rollie pain a fat blunt and a mac 11
that's all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but i'm right on the edge on everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice
well it's probably you am i right if i'm wrong you a fucking lie
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling it's so appealing to pray
i wonder if i'm just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me don't worry bout it
i give 'em back they deposit no money just total silence
i'm running they say i'm wildin' a youngun with lack of guidance
there's hundreds of us with problems more money more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out of control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
that's on my life but regardless i'ma




yeah life can please ya but death can tease ya
on the day niko had that seizure i lost one of my biggest believers ohh
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had the same chance twice what would i do different
i'd tell her i loved her more do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when i'm done recording swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers
don't take too much smoke from the reefer
love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it family having surgeries
hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
lord what kind of life is this
mama i just wanna sing
mama said according to get everything
you gotta risk everything
so i'm smoking my kush reading corinthians
smoking my kush reading corinthians
smoking my kush reading corinthians
smoking my kush reading corinthians

for you to put it on it was early in the morn'

concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction i've outgrown
damn girl why so much
you bout to blow your cover when you cover up
don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
from heaven is where you got it from
i love your smile you can do it without style
from your lips all the way to your eyebrows
it's the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
i don't see it all i see is a blur

i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressing my daddy tired
i need me a weapon these niggas ride
every minute hour and second ministers tried
to save me how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god
heaven or hell base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i deal with ya like my son stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway this for my niggas
uncles twenty three hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that i'm so determined to blow

i'm twenty three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich but wealthy there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful the city got my back
before that i give them my torso
you think about it and don't call me lyrical
cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worry some individuals that live life critical
so won't you bare witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on "wanna be heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio he ain't know
i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it he'll probably be
out of work laid back while he

i been a 1 since day one you niggaz boo boo


how much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling y'all
gotta see how i'm chillin once i park this luxury car
hoppin out feeling big as mutombo twenty on pump six dirty
marcellus called me dumbo twenty years ago can't forget
now i can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
tenfold the liberal concept that what men'll do
twenty oh six he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station a homeless man with a semi tan complexion
asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded asked me to feed him twice i didn't believe it
told him "beat it" contributin money just for his pipe i couldn't see it
he said "my son temptation is one thing that i've defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you   nothin less nothin more"
i told him i ain't have it then closed my door tell me how much a dollar cost


all you neeeeed is more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe


he's starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin he's starin at me i grab my key
he's starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i can see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger like i was supposed to save him
like i'm the reason he's homeless and askin me for a favor
he's starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
he's starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now i'm starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him it'd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
"have you ever opened up exodus 14
 'a humble man is all that we ever need' tell me how much a dollar cost"




guilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck i'm kiddin
so i'ma tell you like i told the last bum crumbs and pennies
i need all of mines and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
i got better judgment i know when niggaz hustlin
keep in mind when i was strugglin i did compromise
now i comprehend i smell grandpa's old medicine
reekin from your skin moonshine and gin
nigga you're babblin your words ain't flatterin i'm imaginin
denzel but lookin at o'neal kazaam your sad thrills
your gimmick is mediocre the jig is up
i seen you from a mile away losin' focus
and i'm insensitive and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said "your potential is bittersweet"
i looked at him and said "every nickel is mines to keep"
he looked at me and said "know the truth it'll set you free
 you're lookin at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power
 the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit the nerve
 of nazareth and i'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss i am god"


i wash my hands i said my grace
what more do you want from me
tears of a clown guess i'm not all what is meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone 
turn this page help me change so right my wrongs
is this mic on hey hey hey

i promised dave i'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
he said "think about what you sayin' fuck niggas"
no better than samuel on "django"
no better than a white man with slave boats
sound like i needed some soul searchin'
my pops gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i'm a dedicate this one verse to oprah
on how the infamous sensitive n word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n e g u s definition: royalty
king royalty   wait listen
n e g u s description: black emperor
king ruler now let me finish
the history books overlooked the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we be using it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put my game in the song
n e g u s say it with me
or say no more; black stars can come and get me
take it from oprah winfrey tell her she right on time
kendrick lamar by far realest negus alive
what money got to do with it
when i don't know the full definition of a rap image
i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized i keep runnin back for a visit
hol' up get it back
i said i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized i can still kill me a nigga so what


if i was the president
i'd pay my mama's rent free my homies and 'nem
bulletproof my chevy doors
lay in the white house and get hiiiiigh lord
who ever thought massa'll take the chains off me

life can be like a box of choc o late
quid pro quo somethin for somethin that's the obvious
oh shit flow's so sick don't you swallow it
bitin my style you're salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
me scholarship no streets put me through colleges
be all you can be true but the problem is
a dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
i'll tell you my hypothesis i'm prol'ly just way too loyal
k dizzle would do it for you my niggaz think i'm a god
truthfully all of 'em spoiled usually you're never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to them fuckin bet awards
you lookin at artists like the harvests
so many rollies around you and you want all of 'em
somebody told me you thinkin 'bout snatchin jewelry
i shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me


shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass nigga
shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass 
shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass nigga
oh now slow down


and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot somethin god bless the kid
took his homies to the show and this is what they said


fuck am i s'posed to do when i'm lookin' at walkin licks
the constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
the private jets and passports presidential glass floor
gold bottles gold models stiffen up the ass for
instagram flicks suckin dick fuck is this
one more suck away from wavin flashy wrist
my defense mechanism tell me to get him quickly because he got it
it's the recession then why the fuck he in king of diamonds
no more livin poor meet my 44
when i see 'em put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick know they your co workers
but it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see i'm on the clock once that watch landin in la
remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
well that's me at these awards 




and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot somethin dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood but you can't
take the hood out the homie took his show money
stashed it in the mozey wozey hollywood's nervous
fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service
i got a bone to pick
i don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again

i'm mad  but i ain't stressin'
 true friends one question

  
bitch where you when i was walkin'
now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta   black man takin' no losses 
bitch where you when i was walkin'
now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams 

  
 the yam is the power that be 
 you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
 i can dig rappin'
 but a rapper with a ghostwriter what the fuck happened
  i swore i wouldn't tell
but most of y'all share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell 
somethin's in the water 
and if i got a brown nose for some gold then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller




 the yam brought it out of richard pryor 
 manipulated bill clinton with desires
 24/7 365 days times two
i was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say

   minus last bar line




i was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
this shit is elementary i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city everybody's screamin' "compton"
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done to be honest
and i put that on my mama and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo~
ah yeah fuck the judge
i made it past twenty five and there i was
a little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin' "annie are you okay annie are you okay"
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

bitch where was you when i was  

 now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta   black man takin' no losses 
bitch where was you when i was walkin'
now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him

this feeling is unmatched
this feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black pendleton ball cap 
we don't share the same synonym fall back 
been in it before internet had new acts
mimickin radio's nemesis may be wack
my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
gamblin benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
winnin in every decision kendrick is master that mastered it
isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction
pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writin blue magic
thank god for rap i would say it got me a plaque
but what's better than that the fact it brought me back home


we been waitin for you waitin for you
waitin for you waitin for you


i know everything i know everything know myself
i know morality spirituality good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you i know everything
i know compton i know street shit i know shit that's conscious
i know everything i know lawyers advertisement and sponsors
i know wisdom i know bad religion i know good karma
i know everything i know history i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
i know everything i know cars clothes hoes and money
i know loyalty i know respect i know those that's ornery
i know everything the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
i know if i'm generous at heart i don't need recognition
the way i'm rewarded well that's god's decision
i know you know that lines from compton school district
just give it to the kids don’t gossip about how it was distributed
i know how people work
i know the price of life i'm knowin how much it’s worth
i know what i know and i know it well not to ever forget
until i realized i didn’t know shit the day i came home




i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro gap in his smile
hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
he looked at me and said "kendrick you do know my language
 you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 oh i forgot don't kill my vibe that's right you're famous
 i used to watch on channel 5 tv was taken
 but never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
 it's just a new trip take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
 make a new list of everything you thought was progress
 and that was bullshit i mean your life is full of turmoil
 you spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you
 i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
 if you resist i'll back off quick go catch a flight or two
 but if you pick destiny over rest in peace
 then be an advocate tell your homies especially to come back home"

the ghost of mandela hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga let me ask this question
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan 
uh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
the ghost of mandela hope my flows they propel it

won't you look to your left and right make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan


do you believe in me are you deceivin' me
could i let you down easily is your heart where it need to be
is your smile on permanent is your vow on lifetime
would you know where the sermon is if i died in this next line
if i'm tried in a court of law if the industry cut me off
if the government want me dead plant cocaine in my car
would you judge me a drug kid or see me as k lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog
want you to love me like nelson want you to hug me like nelson
i freed you from being a slave in your mind you're very welcome
you tell me my song is more than a song it's surely a blessing
but a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question




the ghost of mandela hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that


do you believe in me how much you believe in her
you think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur
you think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt
you think y'all on common ground if you promise to be there first
can you be immortalised without your life being expired
even though you share the same blood is it worth the time
like who got your best interest like how much are you dependent
how clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretendin'
how tough is your skin when they turn you in do you show forgiveness
what brush do you bend when dustin' your shoulders from bein' offended
what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissin'
what kind of bridge did they burn revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
you wanna love like nelson you wanna be like nelson
you wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace makin' seldom
you wanna be remembered that delivered the message
that considered the blessing of everyone this your lesson for everyone say




the voice of mandela hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you ridin' with me nigga


i been wrote off before i got abandonment issues
i hold grudges like bad judges don't let me resent you
that's not nelson like want you to love me like nelson
i went to robben's island analyzin' that's where his cell is
so i could find clarity like how much you cherish me
is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be
see i got to question it all family friends fans cats dogs
trees plants grass how the wind blow
murphy's law generation x will i ever be your x
floss off a baby step mauled by the mouth of pitbulls put me under stress
crawled under rocks ducking y'all it’s respect
but then tomorrow put my back against the wall
how many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead
is it moses is it huey newton or detroit red
is it martin luther jfk shooter you assassin
is it jackie is it jesse oh i know it's michael jackson
oh when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan
that nigga gave us "billie jean" you say he touched those kids
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan


the ghost of mandela hope my flows they propel it
let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you ridin' with me nigga let me ask this question nigga


she just want to close her eyes and sway
if you if you if you
exercise your right to work it out
it's true it's true it's true
shout out to the birthday girls say hey  say hey 
 everyone deserves a night to play 
she plays   only when you tell her no

 
if these walls could talk

if these walls could talk
 ohh


if these walls can talk they'd tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket i'm not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
wall tellin me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me i'm just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean it's still amazing before they couldn't stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when i'm here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around demolition might 




if these walls can talk they'd tell me to go deep
yellin at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down that's my religion
walls feelin like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i don't know how long i can wait in these walls
i've been on these streets too long
lookin at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls are always the cleanest
i beg to differ i must've missed them
i'm not involved i'd rather diss them
i'd rather call on you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon' 




if your walls can talk they'd tell you it's too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
take the recipe the bible and god
wall tellin you that commissary is low
race wars happenin no callin co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say you're reputable not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull like   a killer that turned snitch
walls is tellin me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hopin the warden would afford them

walls tellin you to listen to "sing about me"
retaliation is strong you even dream about me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusin my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently servin life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fuckin on a famous rapper



lovin you is complicate ahhed

i place blame on you still place shame on you still
feel like you ain't shit feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself breakin on marble floors
watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that i'm yours
but you ain't shit i'm convinced your tolerance nothin special
what can i blame you for nigga i can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
a baby inside just a teenager where's your patience
where's your antennas where is the influence you speak of
you preached in front of 100000 but never reached her
i fuckin tell you you fuckin failure you ain't no leader
i never liked you forever despise you i don't need you
the world don't need you don't let them deceive you
numbers lie too fuck your pride too that's for dedication
thought money would change you made you more complacent
i fuckin hate you i hope you embrace it i swear


lovin you is complicate ahhed
lovin you is complicated
lovin you is complicated
lovin you is complicated
lovin you is complicate ahhed
lovin you is complicated
lovin you is complicated

lovin you is complicated

"lovin you is complicated what i got to to do to get to you to get to you"


are you the reason why momma and 'nem leavin
no you ain't shit you say you love 'em i know you don't mean it
i know you're irresponsible selfish in denial can't help it
your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin out
you was deserted where was your antennas again
where was yo' presence where was yo' support that you pretend
you ain’t no brother you ain’t no disciple you ain’t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit or leave his best friend
lil' brother you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas on the road bottles and bitches
you faced time the one time that's unforgiven
you even facetimed instead of a hospital visit
you should thought he would recover well
third surgery they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
then he died god himself will say "you fuckin failed you ain't try"



i know yo' secrets nigga mood swings is frequent nigga
i know depression is restin on yo' heart for two reasons nigga
i know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin nigga
y'all damn near beefin i seen it and you're the reason nigga
and if this bottle could talk 
i cry myself to sleep bitch everything is your fault
faults breakin to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
i know yo' secrets don't let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin and that time you   i'm 'bout to hurl
i'm fucked up but i ain't as fucked up as you
you just can't get right i think yo' heart made of bulletproof
shoulda killed yo' ass a long time ago
you shoulda felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
and if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
and if i told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
hit me~
when the four corners of this cocoon collide
you'll slip through the cracks hopin that you'll survive
gather your wind take a deep look inside
are you really who they idolize to pimp a butterfly


at first i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late night thinkin of you
until i got my nut
tossed and turned lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned all across the board

life no i seen it vividly joggin' my brain memory
life no longer infinity this was the final callin'
no birds chirpin' or flyin' no dogs barkin'
we all nervous and cryin' movin' in caution
in disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet crackin' and crumblin'
the ground is shakin' swallowin' young woman
with a baby daisies and other flowers burnin' in destruction
the smell is disgustin' the heat is unbearable
preachers touchin' on boys run for cover the paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust famous screamin' in agony
atheists for suicide planes fallin' out the sky
trains jumpin' off the track mothers yellin' "he's alive"
backpedalin' christians settlin' for forgiveness
evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out fire burnin' more tires out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom college classroom's been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
 no more runnin' from world wars
 no more discriminatin' the poor
 no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishin' for green and gold the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly a moniker of war 
from heaven that played the symphony thunder like number four
then i heard "what have you did for me" i fell to my knees
pulled out my resume that dated back to june 17th
1987 my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes pray to god that i live forever
dark skies fire and brimstone some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise i thought you said that i'd excel
i made "to pimp a butterfly" for you
told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you say i didn't try for you
say i didn't ride for you i tithed for you
i pushed the club to the side for you who love you like i love you 
crucifix tell me you can fix
anytime i need i'ma start jottin' everything in my diary
never would you lie to me always camaraderie
i can see our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearin' the last trumpet
all man child woman life completely went in reverse
i guess i'm runnin' in place tryin' to make it to church

they say the government mislead the youth youth youth youth

and welfare don't mean well for you you you you

and preacher man don't always tell the truth truth truth truth


    
 head is the answer head is the future
don't second guess yourself

 come on give me some help hey
head is the answer   head is the answer
head is the future   do it for the future girl

come on give me some help


and i just wanna wanna wanna wanna
and i just wanna wanna wanna wanna   straight up 
eyes with my head
and i can use some help   straight up 


head is the future
somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world toooo me
and that means the world to me


somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and this i know

i got 100 on my dash got 200 in my trunk
name in the grab bags put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular i'm drunk
how can i can make them popular pop 'em when i want
see i'm livin' with anxiety duckin' the sobriety
fuckin' up the system i ain't fuckin' with society
justice ain't free therefore justice ain't me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
once upon a time i used to go to church and talk to god
now i'm thinkin' to myself hollow tips is all i got
now i'm drinkin' by myself at the intersection parked
watched you when you walked inside your house you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creepin' through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
every piece of your brain 'til your son jumped in your arms
cut on the engine then sped off in the rain i'm gone




drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle


lit off henny i'm tryna dismantle
these wicked ways i've engaged in such a gamble
cause i could speak the truth and i know the world would unravel
wait that's a bit ambitious maybe i'm trippin'
maybe i'm crazy maybe i exist in a different dimension
not to mention when i close my eyes i see the distance
it's such a scary sight so i rarely go to sleep at night
i watch the sun rise then i watch the sun fall
studied the son of god but still don't recognize my flaws
i guess i'm lost the cost of bein' successful
is equal to bein' neglectful i pray my experience helps you
as for me i'm tryna sort it out
searchin' for loopholes in my bruised soul but who knows
i just need a little space to breathe
i know perception is key so i am king


ooh ooh ooh ooh 
ooh ooh ooh ooh 


the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton they tell me that i'm blind
i know that i'm intelligence my confidence just died


carpe diem seize the day i can't compromise
a tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
a couple trinkets they seein' me as i pacify
but couldn't fathom the meanin' of seein' sacrifice


i'm passin' lives on a daily maybe i'm losin' faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why i'm awake


i'm sleep walkin' i'm street stalkin' i'm out of place
reinforcin' this heat barkin' these are the brakes
before i blink do i see me before them pearly gates
or this is just a mirage or a facade wait
these metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what i seeee
a gemini duality personalities always conflict in meeee

  
oh but don't be scared of me girl 
i know it's foreign to you i know it's hard to believe
god give me the favor 
more than a compliment and i could use some assistance
let me show you how 
oh oh shando i spin around two times
i'll be there with the answer 


i'm bizarre; avant garde
both sides of me are evenly odd
it's attractive; you're intrigued
am i mortal man or make believe
anything you want  i can explain it
any misunderstandings baby  i can explain it
why don't you sit and talk to me awhile  let me explain it
ahhhh yes 


my momma told me that i was different the moment i was invented
estranged baby no i'm not ashamed
i recommend every inch of your lunatic ways praise the lord
you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
you know the male species can be redundant i mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
covers and pillows
i'm promisin' your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
i'm promisin' that i'm acknowledgin' you as my hero cause you believe in me
no you're not easily impressed but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws look at my flaws look at my imperfections in awe
look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and that's alright because i like it you and me are the same
hopefully i'm invited hopefully you don't change

  
because i know for sure who you are 
your momma raised you your daddy raised you
hand washin' your clothes on sunday 
walking your brother to school
three miles away to feed him knowledge so 
don't you explain that
don't you explain the reason why your mind it travels 
i wanna know what you think
i wanna pick your brain when i see you but don't you ever 
oh oh shando i spin around two times
a blessing in disguise~ 
i know for sure who you are
you're the goddess of the odd i am yours 
i am yours i am yours i am yours
i am yoooours yoooours yoooours

yeah yeah young egypt
look look

i feel like pacino in "godfather" i'm charged
our father who art in heaven kendrick at large
came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
what an accomplishment broken promises
kept my focus anonymous 'til i dealt with the consequence
the greatest and latest mogul you know what time it is
you niggas fear me like y'all fear god
you sound frantic i hear panic in your voice
just know the mechanics of makin' your choice and writin' your bars
before you poke out your chest loosen your bra
before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital
avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin' my stock rise
the salary the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid just premium gas do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
black excellence pessimist died countin' my coin
hope it's evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar
on youth centers buildings and beamers and blue leather
forecasted my future this is the future
the mastermind until my next album more power to you 




come on come on come on come on come on
come on come on come on come on come on
come on come on come on come on come on
come on come on come on come on
come on come on

we gon' lay that shit

why so sad


walkin' around with them blue faces
she said "i'm down on my luck
and it's somethin' i gotta have"
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them "color me bad"
blue faces
get that new money and it’s breakin' me down honey


two tears in the bucket i cry with you
uh but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re up
see i barely have patience and you're relatin'
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
you plead the fifth i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut my success corvettes by tomorrow
 now why you so sad




my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
she tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you woman i console you woman
you feel like the universe owes you woman
oh the anticipation of hopin' you could make it
bitches don't prosper chasin' education
but you're talented and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four plus more
if ya can't get it right tell me do you got the stamina
but shit ain't no money like fast money
even today i'm considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasin' stardom how can i fast forward
my accolades better than all them
why you so sad




i wrote this song lookin' at a broke home baby 
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies 
somebody yell "kendrick american they sho' is crazy"
and i said "why" then he looked me in the eye

and said "nigga you fucked up you're bankin' on good luck
you wishin' for miracles you never been through shit
you're cryin' hysterical you settle for everythin'
complain about everythin' you say you sold crack my world amphetamine
your projects ain't shit i live in a hut bitch
i'm livin' to keep warm you livin' to pay rent
i prayed my way through by waitin' on allah
you played your way through by livin' in sci fi
bullshittin' yourself you talkin' to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when y'all came on the boat lookin' for hope
and all you can say is that you're lookin' for dope
these days ain't no compromise
and your pain ain't mines half the time
a brand new excuse ain't shit to me
bitch i made my moves with shackled feet"
cape town


in today's day and age
we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
you wait on them him and her
but when a blessing takes too long that's when you go wrong
you selfish motherfucker 




pimp pimp~ 
when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway a gas pedal and a peace of mind
now that's the ultimate high
to the cloud i go cloud i go
one time baby tell me you need me
cloud i go cloud i go
two time baby tell me you love me


uh cause i've been drinking too much thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
fell into lust where is the love
my independency got tendencies of lack of trust
i look at the street corners as my new woman
seductive as she wanna be hands all on my garments
and luckily being in denial ain't the case
cause i know she's unfaithful instead i'm grabbing her waist
and every part of her is tasteful and i know your feelings hating
in fact you think i'm ungrateful i know
selfish as i wanna be and every time you under me
i get the vibe you might need some time to grow




uh cause i've been drinking too much thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
and every time that i think of your touch
adrenaline pump give me that rush
i'm gone like a thief inside the wind
lord forgive me for my sins
i know she want me more but i fiend for benjamins
she said i found the root of all evil and lost a friend
lost in the world of a young boy from compton
that never knew love because love was never promised i know
selfish as i wanna be
and every time i'm under you me too need time to grow




tell me you love me
two time baby tell me you love me
i don't need i don't need nobody
please shut the front door and walk right in
in the land of the man who rock it hard for them
super solo dolo attack run into that
if you'd like to know yes i am on acid
who could it be k i d
searching all day in the streets for dmt
don't sip it though   it couldn't answer
drip drip all day   bumpin' mgmt homie
watch who you hate on fam' without the facts
sad niggaz back in the hood bumpin' ratatat
to me it was a dream a fiend to understand that
you never seen a nigga like me
i just tell 'em i'm an oxymoron when i open my mouth
cause people talk shit before knowing what i'm about
but for sure these cleveland boys is ill
but pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real it's such a trip
hoes around the globe i'm known to have a fet'
i don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
me and chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
mmm you almost got me but sucker i'm not a sucker
better get on back

and i am not a fronter better look up the facts
the world know what it be:
mr rager solo dolo   see me and repeat it


come come now last call who want some
it's just me two bitches and dirty drums
two lips to kiss 22 other nuns
god blessed my tongue god need it for life
awkward like car rides twiddling my thumbs
pondering my next accomplishments
it's condescending to say i won
two lips you kiss my ass tonight huh


i really want it   i need it
break bread   or break fast
before i blast and break legs ride past
and they scream out "little johnny is dead"
you wish me well i wish you hell
eternity no such thing as time will tell
infirmary burn like magnetic combustion
bad credit with me and paramedics are hustlin'
what's the definition of water
sherm sticks simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
turn quick i don't wanna play this for my daughter
my son heard it probably look at you as his father
i'm proud of myself in a bad way
halfway house tell that to me halfway

hello i would like to tell you about my love affair
with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able
to understand each other and find out about each other
we got to know each other little by little living very close
in the same building and he would help me with things
and i would see him and think "what a cute guy" 
and he was a cute guy
and it was just little by little we got to know just to say hello
one day i invited him to a party and i had heard so much about him
people respected him and he was good to everybody
he knew the people he worked with all adored him
and it was something so important the respect that you have for somebody
for me was the most important
being attracted to him and being finding people respected him
and i respected him i love the fact that he sensed
how my feelings were and i learned to understand and respect
and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time
so it was so very easy to be together
and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed
the more we saw each other
and the more we were together we learned more and more about each other
after a short period of time we became engaged
and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends
the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life
and then came two adorable little boys
and my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys
and i feel i just gave him a wonderful life
a good marriage and a wonderful family
and i know he really had a beautiful life and i did too
and how important it is to love respect and care for each other
so watch 'em do the macarena somewhere out in pasadena
love the drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
you a waste of the space that you take up
living this time around i'm not kidding
i had an intuition about these women in suspicion
got me looking at shit different
how a man in my position can start slipping down these slopes
cuz its all just 
as a kid i didn't learn that but 
when you were young and you were just tryna live your life and have some fun
in the world when you have yet to see how evil its become
its hard to have a dream when you're deep inside of one
and i know you hate them spirits so i keep 'em in my lungs
i'm a beatle to these young kids
sometimes i be feeling like a needle to these young kids
you had the world you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
and we gon' show you what the love is


stay high go for what you know
let it in your mental
and don't ever let it go

you can't fight the feeling feeling
you can't fight the feeling no

you can't fight the feeling feeling
you can't fight the feeling no

band aids don't fix bullet holes 
you say sorry just for show 
if you live like that you live with ghosts mm
 blood runs coooold~

   2x w/ ad libs
and everybody know the story of david and goliath but this is bigger than triumph
this is for the warrior this is for you and i
this is for euphoria give me a piece of mind
god is recordin' this won't you look in the sky
tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
even when stability's never in your favor
fly with the turbulence only last a minute
land on your dreams and recognize you live it
walk through the valley of peace with bare feet 
run through the flames that's more passion for me 
i passed that this morning just so the world can see 
got them wolves on me no watch me lick 'em clean
i know i know my pride my goals my highs my lows
i know i know it's mind control
i know i could prosper no impostor prosecute my posture
i stand up and i stand by her what


i am a freedom fighter the name that history wrote
and even through disaster eye of the tiger for hope
i'm tryin' to find my way back there's no day off for heroes
and even when i'm tired go is the only word i know


and the night is takin' over and the moonlight gets exposure
and the players have been chosen and it seems like fate has spoken
when it seems your faith has broken by the second losin' focus
ain't no way to get off get off get off get off   unless you move forward


i bet they wonder hoooooow i go on go on
i bet they wonder hoooooow i go on go on
i'll simply say "it's on again it's on again"   whoa ohhh
the world don't stop it's on again it's on again   whoa ohhh


i am a lonely hero tryin' to fight my battles
life likes to blow the cold wind sometimes it freezes my shadow
in the midst of all this darkness i sacrifice my ego
there ain't no room for selfish we do it for the people

  


say the work don't stop cause they don't stop
and everybody here tryna get on top
everybody from the 'burbs down to the block
gotta hold on tight and don't let go let go
huh so you think you hot
gotta grind hard give it all you got
you can have or you can have not
you see that a lot in the ghetto ghetto

   minus first four words
like the waters in the open sea
when tribulation come over you say yes hopefully
and yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
but today i'm overly dedicated
i'm posed to be testimony for broken hearts in the city
you're either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
misery love standing behind his company
well vividly i could see that your feelings would like to dwell
on our past encounters reaching over the counter
told me that it's appealing to pop a pill less or down now
i heard emotions burn deep
i heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
i heard when you see a dove that's what you try to be
got these burdens under my wings but i'm still free
cause i can make the decision to let it all go away
before i ever run astray i looked you in the eye and say

let us move on let us move on
for this is short and it will pass
let us move on let us move on
for this is short and it will pass

let us move on let us move on
for this is short and it will pass
let us move on let us move on
for this is short and in the past
and in the past
pardon my bohemian ways
i know i act like i be stuck in a bohemian daze
you said you love me so don't rush me
love is patient and now you gotta trust me
to take form like the canvas of the grand canyon
product of a beautiful storm
or an unborn carried just below the heart
quietly preparing for a start
let me michelangelo my sistine chapel
you know they say rome wasn't built in a day
and diamonds need a while 'fore they hit the display
so i guess i see myself in a similar way
i'm paced like my momma in the kitchen whipping
always mixing up and fixing
begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
she stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
this is not a race track living in the asap
i'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
sometimes i gotta start the bpm
so i can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
in the end i got love for the show biz
but sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
keeping up with the kardashians and joneses
nah i take my time and compose this


they say greatness get better with time
they say concrete roses hard to find
sit inside my room and let these thoughts bloom
it's a secret garden in my mind flower child


okay buffering creativity suffering
when you bustling hustling for the numbers and
you'll miss the journey if you climb too fast
the beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
amateurs swear they need to balance it
i want that legendary like excalibur chasing calibers
liberated as a bachelor traveler
never falling victim to these calendars
uh rough draft after rough draft
no staff perfecting all my abstract craft
and now they calling me celebrity
only thing i give a damn about is my integrity
they play the game like checkers when i'm talking bout chess
tryna do more when i'm talking bout less i stress
quantity ain't always quality
so let me formulate my prophecy


when the lights get low you'll notice i am the sun
the winter time was snow but only little you know
how it still breathe give me the cheese
i'm resuscitating the game see me and cpr my name
is a gun cocked gun shot dead and i won't stop
gun cocked gun shot head in a pine box
with a dozen roses holeless with a gift card
gun cocked gun shot flowers on your momma's yard




they say greatness gets better with time
so why expedite my prime
see i'm just a lilac tied to the earth
exuding the fragrance of light and birth
so respect my photosynthesis
my petals my stems full of nourishing flow
you thought this was a love song but no
i just need you to let me grow

when i kick it i kick it ass as to beat with my enemy
you have thought it was 10 to me on point like a widow peak
got that liberally give them dearies that do what it do
payin a picture like doodling you ain't shit but do do
in the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
you can hide you get it if you want to i do karate moves
but the crush and tigers just might get broken down by a writer
yeah the passenger hopped out but you got shot by the driver
there's a killer like everywhere so why would you take it there
neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
that's why my intelligence tell me to keep a band aid
tell em fuck you i'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
i can flip on some killershit but i'd rather keep cool
keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
nigga that cali cold attack cali on my back to my toy so break nigga
this is where set does game

gangsta gangsta gangsta 

i talk a smitten i'm so religious i blow your wicked
make em close the stiches hells kitchen i'm throwing dishes
this is spoken wisdom as i journey a poet's mission
i'm a lift it my flow is gift it
she cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
low the bisquits let's go to distance
i'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition
they so suspicious low and vicious with no convictions
juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
cold adrenaline i got this soul like a poet's living
so is spitting it's like i'm co existent to prohibition
i'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
disrespect the spirit or the artist who rap with lyrics
mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
and they yeah simplistic they stay out as repetition
show some recognition
heard your album my best of missed it
best that ever did it
papoose is the definition

gangsta gangsta gangsta 
20 plus years of selling johnson & johnson
i started out as a baby face monster
no wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
my teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
gem star razor and a dinner plate
arm and hammer and a mason jar that's my dinner date
then crack the window in the kitchen let it ventilate
cause i let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
nigga i was crack in the school zone
two beepers on me starter jacket that was two toned
four lockers four different bitches got their mule on
black ferris bueller cutting school with his jewels on
couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
what i sell for pain in the hood i'm a doctor
zhivago tried to fight the urge like ivan drago
if he dies he dies like doughboy to tre
if he rides he rides throwing punches in his room
if he cries he cries we don't drink away the pain
when a nigga die we add a link to the chain
inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
we playing on a higher game of chess
once you delegate his bills who's gone fuck his bitch the best
a million megapixels of the pyrex
started on the scale digital my only timex
nigga this is timeless simply cause it's honest
pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
nigga this is simon says simon red
blood on your diamonds til you dying; dead
yah

so watch what you say and where you step mo' carefully
if i fall in the field and ain't no more air for me

'til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked

we gon' have it locked 

we gon' have it locked


i'm part of the small percentage of niggaz who make it out the ghetto
but niggaz tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
it's funny how they come for me when they see me livin comfortably
but when i was broke and sleepin on floors they ain't want nuttin from me
my future's so bright but my past so ugly
and i just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
so i accept what got me here reflectin in this rockin chair
all this space created all that hard work it got me here
so what i look like tellin a nigga that i shouldn't be here
power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
and i'll be that raisin voice that tell the people treat us fair
warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
out in the open all alone i felt the coldest air
secluded in my thoughts of fear no one to talk to no one there
not even a voice not even an ear; no one alive no one to care
now i got a power circle and now i'm on a power trip
and they callin me counterfeit cause i ain't gave a coward shit
stone me throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
it's funny how it comes full circle now they wanna be a part of the power circle

they wanna be a part of the power circle



may the wind be at your back
may the bad be in yo' past
may the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
and you realize your goals
and what's life without grind

there's enemies envy but green my niggaz lawnmower
and i'm on tour jordan 4's tom ford
and i ain't thuggin they clappin at me a encore
got a dark heart bright mind make women crazy
i give her d i throw up two i call that shit a safety
shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertainin
and my inner sanctum need real estate i'm out my cabeza
jealousy's for the weak ye ain't happy i made it
i be feeling like brother malcolm just added a nation
allah got us cause if we holla they'll all snub us
i seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggaz grandmothers
so shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians
my circle's small but regardless my circumference official
my clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
they gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
i'm so allusive saw my niggaz be goin through it
i guess it's a wrap when your co defendant makes soul music
cash rule the world at least it do with girls
at least it do with churches see the truth and true it hurts
if they real then they real my niggaz deserve it
and we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle


yeah meek milly this maybach <strong></strong>
uhh~ i'm like welcome to the power circle
i came a long way i started with a powdered circle
clique full of real niggaz that'll probably merk you
cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
lotta talking lotta tweetin 'til you hear that chopper speakin
kill my dog i kill your dog we tied even i believe it
if you see it then you got it nigga never give up
cause if you grindin you gon' be rich before you can look up
my cousin knock told me never teach niggaz to cook up
cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hook up
and still make the profit the streets say i'm the hottest
and a nigga still modest i'm just bein honest
back to the wall never let 'em get behind us
mack in my draws fittin right in my designers
look at my persona i dreamed it woke up and conquered
and there was commas after commas i eat 'em like benihanas
put the shrimp over the pasta the pasta over the lobster
and the lobster over the table power circle a mafia
just talkin money talkin money what you talkin bout
probably talkin bout us we the only thing to talk about

we the only thing to talk about

cause we the only thing to talk about


look inside the highs of the last mohicans survived
you won't last a weekend outside
seen a pastor tweakin then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
see a demon don't compromise
and so i walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
i'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
i might as well put all my killers in ysl
put my voice on this microphone put you pussy niggaz through hell
hell's fire i never lie you'll never grind
i know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime
i know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
when they heard that ohio state gave me 30 racks in july
oh lord this can't be life no it can't be life
when the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
from upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
it's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
down your fate you record it that night a reporter replied
the death rate will eventually climb so eventually i'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
so about face if it ain't business i get offended i mind
no one fake i'm a realest in strive of a bilion in five
well a billion cause the limit is the sky and i live on cloud nine
and i recognize my nemesis gon' try but i'm finishin my shine
but pussy where it hurt you life in the power circle


regardless of how it goes down 
life goes on am i right
tried to warn you niggaz

lifestyles of a kid that never had shit
living off that bad shit that shoot shit that stab shit
rock a flag and don't give a fuck about us flag shit
george bush got some nerve fuck a war we tryna serve
motherfucking eight balls till we live at the pool hall
and knock billiards out of business ya bitch
that's my surroundings in compton have common sense
smell death in the air round here that's a common scent
you know the gunpowder
you when your homie barely blink he just done powder only at seventeen
you know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
now hired by street schemes of getting blood money
i try my best to stay focussed and hope the city love me
pray it's not lust cause if it is i'll be dead in a month
lord forbid for the good kid they took his life
she want her baby back like a cooked rib but that's just life
where i'm from


if there's a shining star
hope my city's not too far
so we can live again
see where i come from it's hard
hope all over we can start
so we can live again so we can live again


i seen this youngun on the train i had to pick his brain
he said he on his way uptown to get a brick of 'caine
he said he needed a come up cause selling nicks was lame
he needed a change so i gave him fifty cent
he looked at me like i was crazy i said listen man
i'd rather give you my last to see you live again
just cause you change what you pitching don't make the difference
you gotta get off the mound and put the game down
petty thoughts could keep your brain down
i leave you with that jewel go get the chain now and put it together
see coming up we ain't have shit to keep our mind focussed
i love mike but it was a hassle trying to buy jordans
my nigga hustled all day in front of the corner store
to get a pair and niggas killed him right in front of the mall
huh so all that hustling for nothing then
i threw my pair on the light pole because of him
like fuck it man




tryna move forward though it never stops
a mother's son dead was killed by some kids popped shots
they back and forth
murder for murder the beef recycled is vital
no idols bunch of 'em read bibles
allies that turned to rivals niggas turned street disciples
smokers get high as eiffels
addicted to being fiends cause of feds as we pledge to let our plague spread
tiny this and if it that they banging back
as they a dapt to being black straps and gang tats look
rats get mouse traps can't afford tuition
but hit a lick i bet i earn crack i heard that
looking at the sky just hoping that a light will shine
daylight saving time all the time on this block of mine
all the time with this glock of mine
swear to god man it ain't a rhyme i grind for a piece of mind
co sign




"when you look at my brothers what's your first impression
 does the sight of us leave you guessing or do you understand the stressing
 the aggression the look of no hope on my niggas' faces
 like the lord overlooked us when he handed down his graces
 you see embraces fall short on the numb tips of street entrepreneur fingers
 stuck on the walls of the project halls where the coke smell still lingers
 external blingers is all we can be cause on the inside we've been given nothing to shine on
 and a gig is harder to get than coke so niggas get they grind on
 cause the tv tells us aim high nigga make all goals lateral
 but see that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put they souls up as collateral
 now some niggas reclaim 'em some blame 'em make an excuse to sell 'em
 but when a nigga goes from not doing to doing what can you tell him
 not to be a nigga shit i gots to be a nigga that's how i pay the bills
 and i'ma do that whether i got to sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills"

i remember when it all started
on alondra in that small apartment burgundy carpet and sega cartridges
poppa flicking blunt ashes all on his garments
momma off of wine cooler magic johnson playing jordan
i was only four but it's like i heard it before
a house party cracking off of the music doctor record
and according to my awareness i was more than coherent
a cold listener marking that shit like a parrot
my cousins kicking up dust cripping they flag wear it
round they hand like a mitten aiming use it for leverage
shitting on compton sheriffs like "fuck the police"
woofers and gold rollies every swap meet should know me
cause i copped every record that dropped
dropped a dub just to hear doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip hop
whoever thought the moment i seen you on bullis for "cali' love"
fifteen years later you'd be saving my life what


hiipower

every tick i'm repping my city 
ten bottles at a time this here is the life
and how i'm living might be wrong
but in this world what the fuck is right
it's just one rapper 2 cups 3 bitches blowing me
heard it's 20 niggas in the vip then bitch you know it's me
i'm here for niggas go and do them bizz
getting tired of hearing rappers just rapping the shit i live
all that i got is my all that's exactly what i get
and i need my toilet paper every time i do my shit
guess i should switch cause i'm getting paid
instead of worrying bout how i'm getting money just do the same bitch
the bright lights and people screaming my name
fuck the money and the fame bitch that's the reason i came


i remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
i remember i remember why we don't fuck with none of these niggas
i remember oh my how the times change

oh my how the times change getting change

nothing's the same but still remember why i came
oh my how the times change getting change

driving on a freeway full of darkness
it's just me and plus my heart is cold
as an project carpet
you be coughing up commode
full of shit see i was told
that only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
and look at you i know you starving see it's burning in your soul
and you look for me to console your emotions
i'm on the road and i'm joking with all my niggas
we laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
and i hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
and don't get me wrong you was in the zone of a lifetime
but the place you belong is the bottom
that's why i got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
and some scenos a combination that we know
uh tight rope but i notice they walk a thin line
from having the disabilities of death dumb and blind
every time i recline then remind myself
i would never die with pussy less it was on my dick pussy




staring out a benz window thinking bout saying fuck it
i make it and spend it all
middle finger for a budget
got your rent off in my pocket and spent off a piece of luggage
got a lot of bad habits with money some shit i'm stuck with 
nothing but dollars in my discussion show my ass out in public
cause motherfuckers love it i hear 
niggas out here plotting on the come up
i hold this gun up then one of these coward niggas run up
my nigga dead so for him i'm lighting my blunt up
i say "hustle for this rap bitch i'm getting this from sun down to sun up"
i know it's niggas hating praying i never make it
but jealous pussy i'm here and i'm never leaving just face it 
before one of these niggas take me out this motherfucking game

i take 'em out they misery make it harder to breathe
ain't no problem to me call me father mc
pay homage to a god bitch fall on your knees
hood booger wannabe housewife gassed off nini
hot sadiddy needy try to emulate the tv
but this real fuck how you feel
call of duty mode with these verses lot of kills
first niggas doubted the flow now how you feel

gimme mines i really rhyme yep really i'm
one of the illest niggas doing it or these niggas is losing it silly minds
they try to style on a new york nigga
like my flow ain't cold like a new york winter
i don't stunt i regulate seen empires separate
best friends kill best friends every day
for petty sake not even heavyweight it's never good
there's a rich porter story in every hood dza

  
no matter how far we go
we forever be real we'll never fold
know my niggas stay down we all we know
we gotta get it so we live it
just remember what we do and won't stop


my turbulence put a burden on young herbs
once it's cracking it's a chain reaction minus yung berg
i'm on the verge of excellence kill 'em off with no evidence
take a shot at the exorcist then x 'em out with these words
panoramic views be tumbling out of my mind
this ain't 1992 bullets tumbling out no nines
big aks like alicia keys abbreviated
and nowadays niggas stand behind 'em like clive davis
clyde drexler before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on that stretcher
an understatement said that k lamar was under pressure
don't press your luck when i'm pressed for time
cause when the press get this verse they sure to press rewind
the president's prayer can't save us in my cul de sac
there's codeine crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smiling
while we whyling on them corners with the ropes and rats
nigga build a trap house hope his homie don't run his trap
see the feds and tap out that's wrestler shit
don't rest your case as a gangster just cause you wrestled your bitch
we move in silence like the potato tip when we riding
and we ride rotten two choppers found thirty sirens
you ain't been where i been i know where i'm going and life's a bitch
i know that she hoeing i know that i'm sewing what i reap
and know that i'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
and if i don't speak i know you ain't growing
cause i'm a leader respect it when you see him
accepted by your new bitch your old bitch and your bm
y'all always on that bs and ps i'm taking all things
i'm taking off first this g6 is on its way what's up
kendrick kendrick lamar

got my 9 11 niggas with me they craving for beef
let the chopper sing to 'em like franky sinatra
high school nigga probably got shoved in a locker
this for my niggas up top getting ready for lock up
these rap niggas weak x 'em out like a pop up
known for making movies give 'em an oscar
fucking low junky part reason why they stock up
hoes fall through the show spending cake to watch us

sore losers never can play as a 
send shooters on your block skirting off on a scooter
i'm raising my stock with every hit record look at my record
your status will drop as soon as they message me in a session
minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
you posing as a poser we post your death on a poster
your highlight is getting closer to stardom we never stalling
we starve 'em and tire mark 'em in the dust so you can watch 'em
in god trust i'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
time's up you play softer than damian
we aim it at you cranium and leave fragments over the stadium what

rather watch the nixon shit than politicians politic
cnn and all this shit gwaan yo move with the fuckery
trump and the snl hilarity
troublesome times kid no times for comedy
bloodclaat you doin' bullshit you spewin'
as if this country ain't already ruined
in lieu of these mumbling fumbling swearing they're the greatest
online they debate us if we different then we're haters
we ended our hiatus the dogs looking for food
the nucleus is here now 


toleration for devastation got a hunger for sin
every nation abomination let the coroner in
crooked faces red and blue laces for the color of men
just embrace it and die alone song of revelation
reverends and cattles racing devils and demons and deuteronomy
fumigate our economy 'lluminate broken dreams
and manifest all insanity look around
sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground

the the the reason that i'm breathing
seeping heat gets me cheese while i'm eating in bad season
was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys
and obstacles made it possible for the flow gotta be profitable
yo tech's audible his inarguable product popped it was plausible
god is so good for giving me music
lifting getting me through when i was fixing to lose it
dudes hit big scoob's shit and repping the blue tip
fool's skipped it was  we jumped in the two whip
full clips for who stick the homie for true grip
my crew thanks to music we all living through it
got me out of the ghetto got me mucho dinero
in cozumel mexico shorts and jordans and a sombrero
this gift ain't given from a devil so settle
come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle pendejo
saved my life paid my lights made my wife say "bye bye"
gave my night babes i like prayed my mic
would never fade forever slayed days i write
my cheddar raise up better phase way high hyped
my music's one reason i always get to lay my pipe
the reason tech nina can comfortably say "night night"
blessed me with original flow so hey why bite
i hear i feel i live listen and learn i like


i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 


automatic when i do this manually
daily monthly annually i get a step closer to being the coolest
acoustic got me fooling about to lose it ooh shit
jump in the grind and my homie mike produced it   that's music partna
i'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
i don't mean to toot my own horn but toot toot ha ha
i laugh because it's easier than do re mi fa so la
ti do we know he go  on that c note
and he can play a c note with that b note i'm talking truth
and i got stories that will show you that it's walking proof
a thousand miles of it and i can show you what i'm walking through
music ain't a hobby it's an organ of my body
that the creator provided back in january of '92
so don't you dare say good music skipped my generation
your hating ain't nothing but motivation for these compilations oob'


i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 


music is my life the reason why i write
like edgar allen poe on the beat like a parasite
you thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
nobody tried my limits cause they're afraid of heights
they ambition weak or gravity let 'em die
i let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
time and time again i treat my pen like the pen
bars harder than pelican bay and i been
serving a life sentence since the day i was ten
nine times out of ten you only ten songs deep
before you leap into a pool of sharks then swim
that's an analogy on the way i do casualties
and i do this shit casually before the first end
i'll be in the hall of fame with my picture framed friend


and if it wasn't for 
yeah i wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for 
you wouldn't have nothing to hear yeah
and i love


i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
i love music 
 
i love music 
i love music 


wake up~
you said you'd never ever break down
but here i am sweeping pieces off of the ground
you said you'd never ever play to crowds
but i've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
i've spent all night long scared of tomorrow i broke my alarm
everything is almost lost pick it up slow before it's gone


we're fragile

i never thought i'd be so fragile

if it didn't break before it's about to

i don't ever want to change
i'm fragile
i don't ever want
i don't ever


some of the people appointed to give an opinion
never do get it
i want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and die
n9na be givin the remedy and why
critics are really the enemy and i
can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
effin' incredible get fanned away with grands to pay
this jam will lay scripted
deaf and impeccable
write a rhyme and i put everything in a flow
i'm the n9ne i'm a look very mean
when a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
by the times it'll be better leave it in the sto
cause they wrote nothin' but lies quotes stuck in my eyes
amateur writer dissin'
he's a beginner and hopes for your demise folks i'm a despise
never do try to listen
it's real   i'm mad
clueless when you scribble on your pad

you don't really get why i'm so pissed understand this:
i'm an artist and i'm sensitive about my shit yes i'm




tell me that i'm famous
tell me that my name is
big as venus jupiter and then uranus
tell me that your anus got your head in it
i can smell the articles and know you're heinous
tell me that you love me always thinkin' of me
unconditional i'm hoping i'm your favourite
grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
that's the feelin' i get when you're concentratin'
on this pen on this pad
tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
stop
puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
lookin' to bury a deep hole for mine
drop
this is more than you and this is more than you

i'ma see you again
and when they ask you questions
you just answer what happened then
what happened then


i live this life at a pace that anyone can go
know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that you'll die alone
trace your steps when i do step in the fire of broken bones
and i require my heart's desire and when i reap what i sew
i bought my momma a benz my boobie a jag
a cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass
but still i be feelin like none of my light never casts
out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
but fuck that i'm not worried mm even when discouraged mm
skirt off makin them hurt off should've hurt them in a hurry mm
dirt off all of my fingers dirt him all of 'em gone is buried mm
shirt off when precedure resuscitation came early
i need you to keep quiet as a mouse
which is ironic cause rats is what i'm talkin 'bout
i'm hearin the sonics of gunfire the whispers the silent cries
even though we know it's eye for an eye




i was born a soldier
ride or die for mine
tied two tears and a lawyer
tried to give me love
heaven can you heal me
i know that hell can
so heaven can you heal me
i'm only just a man ohhhhh

colombian neck ties on the outside from within
and then your momma never see you again
casket to never wake up plastered in mac make up huh
niggaz can't hear you talkin from the sky
and only 5 year olds see your ghost when you die no lie
karma catches up to all you head honchos
two dome shots in that head griselda blanco

nigga livin that fast life and get killed slow
ask wack and draws if a nigga run the streets
my grandmother's prayers saved you niggaz i never wanted peace
los angeles i'm the motherfuckin king here

huh


ay in my apartment a long time ago i knew a bad bitch but she was kinda slow
still gave it up when it's a few of us; she let me finger fuck her on the school bus
we used to cut school with her and run train she wanna hang with us we want one thang
just penetratin that throat dawg   she choke on it like smoke dawg
but whenever i fucked up my re up in a dice game i go see her
she'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce and then blow a blunt of that reefer
she used to buy a nigga new sneakers pay the bill on my beeper
just so she could page to put a "69" and i know it's time to go freak her
then one day i just asked her "why you always give ya ass up
i mean damn these hoes get paid all you do is get laid this shit don't add up"
she said "tip all i wanna do is feel love even if i know it ain't real love
even if i know a nigga only finna hit it then never call back i still fuck"
and that's fucked up cause she's so trill i need somethin she go steal
when the trap hot and police ride nigga guess where we go chill
about fo' years she held dope and my fo' pound 'til it go down
i remember shawty she stayed down i won't say her name cause she married now


when the lights go out and i'm in my bed
i think of all the madness in my hea aaaaaaaaaaaaaad
oh oh ohhhh all of the things that i did back then
ohhhh when i'm in my bed
i think of all the memories i've ha aaaaaaaaaaaaaad
oh oh ohhhh all of the things that i did back then


yo yo uhh
she would always turn heads when she fall through she would always make moves how a boss do
and she never gave any nigga time of day but she the chick all the niggaz tried to talk to
but when it came to me she had a thing for me when we kicked it she rolled up the weed for me
and we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady watchin just to see if the police comin
we got close over time her and i right around the time that i first got signed
come to think about it i was 'bout 17 i ain't even have a license couldn't even drive
i was goin back and forth with these flights another show after show each night
she became so suspicious of these other bitches she'd go through my phone and we'd fight
talk about torn between the two wasn't really much more that we could do
wasn't really much space for us but she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
but i guess one night i had a few huh one night i had a few
yeah this lil' chick that caught my eye i told her "hurry up meet me at the room"
and no i didn't have a contraceptive and my common sense neglected
and two months later next thing i know i got a text that said "i'm pregnant"
and you can almost bet she kept it and that's the reason why you left me
on top of all that it wasn't even mine i went and got paternity tested
damn




wait hold up is that you with them big ol' thighs after school
jay 305 had gave me high five when i said i'm in hot pursuit
you said "i won't ride until kendrick drive a new monte carlo that cruise"
and that shot my pride i tried to improv but no freestyle'll ever do
you're lookin for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
you're overlookin every nigga that ain't quite ready
to make it rain on you like about to break a levee   hold up that pussy petty
yeah yo' nails did yo' hair did yo' cell phone is selfish
it only got numbers that come with a hummer her new primadonna i smelt it
tried to make you mine hoe tried to make some time hoe
but i ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line hoe
her dreams holds versace she fall for armani
only deal with rich niggaz fuck you and mitt romney
i'm grown now i'm on my own now i'm po o o oppin
change my phone now when i get home now i got o o o options
fast forward wait is that you with them big ol' thighs after school
and yo' three kids and three baby daddies and car note that's overdue
i know




high rises day breaks
clouds hide the sun's rays
quicksand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it's darkest before light
i'm gonna push through


turbo charged bars
slot cars on track falling off
game stars in these rap wars
ain't nothing band aids won't cover
touring with 7d coverage live bands two buses
my own cash no budget no major label fundings
jets baby we went from crawling to walking to running
you can't say nothing you under gag order
hopping out of audis hurting y'all with kicks i'm the transporter
think about it never mind you ain't gotta
i'm already on some whole other word to your motherfucking self
nobody else gon' do it for ya nobody else
every now and then somebody will off you help
but they ain't doing nothing till they really see you tryna do something
i ain't bluffing kush puffing on you jive turkeys
stuffing stockings with these gifts
audible applaudables homie take a whiff yeah




yeah when you a man action is what's expected nothing is spoken on
producer never got time for no excuses you gotta go beyond
my flow is tom foolery
i smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
i beautifully exude the vibe that's free of ambiguity
your goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
it's coonery it's lunacy
let's make a plan only way that you hang is attached to a tree
the moon talk to the sea and speak with body language fluently
she make it rain when i'm on fire she always try to douse me
only reason that you make it rain is cause your diamonds cloudy
i see you from a mile away when it get overcast
old people feel it in they bones invade your home
like i broke the glass and let myself in fighting for freedom
like the people in tunisia and spread through sudan and egypt
this the music for the movement the score to your achievements
never join 'em so you gotta beat 'em it's carpe diem hey  yeah




uh huh yeah like kindergarteners my vision's bothered
by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya the starving'll speed on ya
stampede on ya impede on your pockets then pee on ya
dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
spending established with women dining and laughing
but this environment got us violent ready to crash in
to society take this driver seat hope you fastened
your seat belts twice when i rolled them dice i crapped
so many times i can build casinos from scratch
too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve relax
that's what my mental say but my physical's been detached
i'm on some other shit like fuck the government i'm higher rankings
where's the mothership i made a covenant that i was changing
but my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
where the fuck you been left him face down like he was planking
in a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
you can bench curl your tribulations that sensation's insulting
got a wifey or a mistress nigga which one you indulging
regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focussed
nigga i'm focussed


baby i wanna i wanna get you to understand
i love you and i love her too
but that may be too much for you to deal with
so i wrote a song about it you wanna hear it
well here it go


my life is mardi gras and she's the life of the party y'all
it's like "ring around the rosie" when i came around they chose me
and i make 'em feel famous famous famous famous
winner's circle the square don't fit
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship now
livin life in a triangle ship now now
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship now
livin life in a triangle ship now now
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship now


yeah i'm caught up in the middle of this love thang
i keep tryin to escape the ball and chain
my main dame holds me down for the winner season
my side piece just a winner that's for many reasons
insecurities inside of myself
have me not be able to picture you with nobody else heh
i'm caught up between two beautiful women
who both cook clean and play they position
it's like i know i'm wrong but i can't seem to get it right
process of elimination hell of a decision to make
take two  and add me
never knew a real commitment would ever involve three
the one she got a temper always make sure i'm fed
the other one she leaves me lonely cause she's focused on the bread
yeah can't a man ever be so lucky
i guess that's why these women don't trust me a 3chordfold




it's hard bein a star of a plot when
 love and lust at the same time goddamn
so i doubled up put five on they gotten
gambled with they hearts had the ball and i dropped it
to leave'll be the death of me dearly departed
don't know how i got by bein partially honest
a thin line between love and hate yeah i crossed it
wait~ love is no guarantee i got options
fate is me and her  it's me and she 
multiple choices not a and b
a test i was destined to fail fo' sho boy
rather be stingy than see you huggin on ol' boy
oh boy i'm just a man with a lotta love to give
and i hope you understand it was never my intent
to mislead me to of you but it is what it is
cupid tried to aim straight but i guess cupid missed   3chordfold


every day i try to escape the realities of this world
so i tell a disc jockey press play while i press up on a girl
in the midst of the smoke in the air the reflection of lights that glare
she'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight i might have to stare
and that's power steering a power trip you see in my appearance
a pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in a darkest dungeon
speakers bumping drinks is pouring we in the house we paid the mortgage
tyrannosaurus that's real big pop my collar pop that lid uh


flashing lights model types vixens show me much love
put the bottles on that ice drink like we supposed to
fire burning heads is turning all i see is energy
so eventually we'll do this till the sun come up the sun
we'll do this till the sun come up the sun
smoke like this till the sun come up the sun
we'll do this till the moon is dropping daybreak watching
then do it again


some people stay home and sleep me i go out at night
all seven days of the week i live the party life
i got my dogs with me you can bring some of your friends
we going hard till the sun come up and do it again
i got a drink in my hand they playing my favorite song
this girl that's dancing on me ain't got no panties on
and she gon' come back to my hotel don't tell
anyone about us said i'm here to party all night




come to my section  and down some of this liquor 
then tell me what it hit for 
gon' be some things i don't remember 
so take some camera phone pictures


come to my section  and down some of this liquor 
then tell me what it hit for 
gon' be some things i don't remember 
so take some camera phone pictures


tuh it's big tm leaning off the seagreens
eyes bloodshot look at 'em and you'll see him
now who we've become but his mother's son
the same one who avoided guns and picked up the drums
had you marching to a different beat stood you on your feet
i looked out helped you off the streets
i gave you advice to heed a new life to lead
in return you took my kindness for weak
when i was at my lowest truest colors started showing
niggas i called friends wasn't answering they phone then
cuh that's when quik' words rang true
be careful who you hand your celebrity to
uh didn't get it till that very instant
since then between me and them i put a little distance
niggas so lame for saying bro it's a shame
disloyal like a hoe sold you soul for this game
and you still broke nigga


sometimes people go as quick as they come
they say that there's nothing new under the sun
cause time reveals all the reasons
things change in life just like seasons


little kendrick from the hub
can show you that my motive's always been to give you love
i'm putting out good music in return to build a buzz
that's bigger than life itself or some bubble kush plug
won't you look the mirror you see a pair of eyes that's quite similar to mines
and if you do that shit should scare ya
baby brother of compton tryna the accomplish the impossible
with obstacles at my daily grinding ohh no
here come the critics but not from the magazines i mean
the blocks that be so called mad at me they're mean
as soon as success is in my favor
they'll try to break down my character like i ain't from their heritage
quite frankly it'll hurt my soul to hear a nigga that i know
talking bad and tryna play me
like we ain't had pellet gun fights falling off of minibikes
in a buick bumping clipse with no ac why would you shame me




yeah mm so i was driving home last night on the 1 0 1 freeway
and i look up and there's a sign that says 'love your friends and love your family'
and i thought to myself why do we use these words so loose
love friends and family
i mean if love is involved why do friends and family hurt us
and why do we hurt them
it's kind of like we all forgot the true definition of love to begin with
tuh the one thing i do know i nor you can be accountable for what somebody else does to us
we can only be accountable for what we do to them
so instead of saying that's my friend that's my family and it's love
huh i'ma say this to y'all


so many words we say ain't really
what are we really saying
people never change
truth will be the same
return of the mack 
return of the mack
return of the mack 
you know that i'll be back 
return of the mack  
return of the mack 
return of the mack  
you know that i'll be back 


today is the day i get out on my feet
remove them chains that's shackled on me
press my luck stop fuckin with them hoes that cluck
cause the same motherfuckers the one that got me stuck
tryna use me up 'til my tank on e
then leave me stranded scramblin in these streets
for a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
soon as you move out the hood them niggaz holla ya fake
make 'em swallow the bass from the kicker
i'd rather be a dead man than a nigger
i'd rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
i gotta make moves i cain't hang witcha
they used to be the fly shit back in '95
but now i want a crib and a car i can drive
and ain't nobody out there help me cause i'm grown
gotta leave them childish games alone
nigga i'm on


chea i'm in the hood still prayin for a piece of plate
i know he on his way i'm hopin he don't make it late
i'm up the bat i just hope i make it to the plate
i'm babe truth you can tell 'em i'm one of the greats
used to shoot for the stars now my aim locked
i'm tha truth nigga something that your name not
a thousand watts ain't a thing that i cain't shock
and ain't a wrist or a chain that i cain't rock
tell 'em i'm on somethin like city lights
i used to be out they sights tinted like city nights
now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
you can tell 'em i put on for my city in plenty fights
tell 'em i ain't gon' lose they heated like i'm a tan man
'bout to throw em in this drop with no ceilings so i can fan 'em
pull up on the mic  same color as the phantom 
and jump out on haters just to tell 'em i couldn't stand 'em


yeah yeah
i'm on top of my game yo 
the og grand daddy kush cocaine flow
i'm about that cash not that tango
head shots dump a whole clip in ya kangol 
claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though 
i be in the hood all the places you cain't go 
visuals you can see the pictures i paint yo
residuals i just put it all in the bank yo it's pitiful
hoes only after your bankroll
stay off the phone watch out for the plain clothes 
yeah i rep my set i ain't in the gang though 
and i protect my neck i carry the thing yo 
i'm on the same shit that the boss is on
do it for those in the feds up north or gone 
i'm on a winning streak i done got my losses on

may the force be with you bullet hit you
you bleed then i bleed with you
mama please when you grieve damn i grieve with you
this a preview i see you in the summer
my new shit dumber i'm on


life at the bottom is devastating
you're hardly ever debated the party is obligated
by suckers that wanna be you and never live in the matrix
and never ever related to struggle and dedication
your hustle is nominated anonymous then you faded
the promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
they vomited everytime that a rapper's annihilated
just wish them happy belated   fuck you~ i made it i'm on


tokyo to amsterdam denver to la 
minutes turn to hours and hours to pay 
the days turn to nights but the nights never change
it's funny how "time is money" used to be a turn of phrase
but now it's company policy i'm no spokesperson 
no tricks no gimmicks no coercion 
and they say "bob man it's good to have you back" 
but i say "i have been here where the fuck have y'all been at"


hah thinkin how pac lived at 22 that's '93
i was four now i'm 22 on tour
one two shots of my life barely hold on
but i'm drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
when mic's on lights on and they gon' applaud
young nigga versace they never seen before
and they gon' watch me wanna copy shit i got on
i'm too fly i ain't got a flaw
tell the law we above the law
god bless amen every lost soul 
and the group so good went solo
globetrottin now i'm blowin up like an afro
nigga thought you knew what i do
rollin through ya area double r coupe
penthouse level now we only party on the roof
bitch i'm a rebel so i move how i wanna move
last king ymcmb 


used to run around the hood pickin honeys up
now i'm doin shows 'round the world pickin money up
used to be slept on like a pillow
went from trappin in a rental to rappin on instrumentals
now it's money on my mental and women get sentimental huh
it's cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles nah
yellow gold yellow diamonds in the middle now
stand up nigga i was never known to settle down


well as the world spins around and around on its axis
boys flip from town to town with the package
stuffin bills and pounds of browns in a mattress
sendin clowns underground for practice
the fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown 
but never in the battle when the drama goes down 
easy to be the boss from behind the wall
but we gon' see who really down when it's time to brawl 
cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying 
you gotta show love to where you from all day
and when the goin gets rough don't get to goin get to stayin
put it down for yo' people with no delayin know i'm sayin

i ran out of tears when i was 18
so nobody made me but the main streets
cause too many people think they made me
well if they really made me then replace me
homeless to forbes list these niggas bring no stress
i feel like moses i feel like i'm chosen
and if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
i don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
grew up with no father so nobody ever son'd me
my flow too sick kevin costner couldn't touch me
i know you wish that nobody ever love me
i feel useless when i'm never makin' money
well this the life we always fantasized
rich folk problem through a queen street nigga's eyes
every time you see me pullin' up in aventadors
just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
 

sidewalks saved my liiife
they don't ever lie
sidewalks saved my liiife
they showed me all the signs
 

they don't let me down
but they lead me on
and they don't let me do own
but they lead me onnnnn
and they lead me on

say say say trippin' off dyke and my name strike with payday
say say say flippin' blue lightnin' tightenin' strapped with ak

how to segue pussy power profit in headache
i reminisce my life innocence or life innocent or life intimate with fame
light limo tint with light women dark women in it awe kenny good game

astronomer anonymous; i line 'em up we grind 'em up there's nine of us

"there there baby it's just textbook stuff
 it's in the abc of growing up"


yeah three women raised me famous footwear paid me
not enough to blow up but showed up cause i ain't fucking lazy
and teachers thought i was dumb or crazy or both
with hopes of being a nas or jay z i slumped
in my chair and my grades my hair wasn't waves
being fly was priority to the lowest
i would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way
the dead society of a poet homie i'm focussed
but that's something that a dude can't prove
i mean fam i was damn near invisible at school
so i banged for a minute cause all my niggas was cripping
just me and two of my dudes blue man crew
had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
cause everything ain't black and white 'less you chew bamboo
so i was after big bills like a toucan do
all the while my mom asking why i'm truant at school she said




yeah uh so why ain't i go college
my momma's ultimatum made me say that i know i got it
my niggas said v's bugging
stay on your computer software debugging but we holding hardware cause we thugging
now they in the trap house with some guns that they done borrowed
and all this snow/aldis snow i call it "infant sorrow"
with plans to reach the end even if i had to start slow
sold cds in the mall making dough like sbarro
then i left the hood like fuck it don't need the cargo
they banking i don't do "well" and i don't mean fargo
but even when you leave somehow it still try to follow
baby brother took a charge harder than lebron and rondo
tryna keep his head up while his eyes are in the bible
cause they a mind that's idle is a devil's toy aisle
my nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
i looked at him told him sit down this information is vital look




living my life like i'm living right
in the midst of a fire pit the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song and i roam with the heart of a violin
don't violate my patience i'm waiting to kill a man
as i stare at the ceiling fan as a fan of these wicked streets
if i gotta eat i steal/steel like a metal piece
i'm screaming out fuck the police i'm dealing my cards with jokers on 'em
you can disown him or stone him i'm throwing them rocks back
with the fury of bullets you couldn't live your life for the moment
when i'm foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
i'm in the back of a black buick finna black out
like february ain't that's how blacks do it right
i cut off my ears before i hear your advice and vice versa
i'm screaming for help as loud as i can but that's not working
i'm working them corners like blueprints then caught an l on my first offence
the judge threw the book at me then said this
