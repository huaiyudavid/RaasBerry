artist: bg f/ lil' wayne juvenile
album:  it's all on u vol 2
song:   i'm tryin'
typed by: markthomas@netalphanet
  
verse one: bg

i'm tryin' to do right
but i'm surrounded by wrong
avoid the all night flight
and still make it on my own
i'm tryin' be cool 
do what i gotta do
but playa haters all over
so i roll with my crew
i'm tryin' stay over
and just stay my ass in school
ain't  many choices to choose
and this rap game i can't refuse
i wanna win don't want to be the one to loose
my pistol my only friend
cause busters try to bring the blues
leavin brains with no clues
spin the ben in black clothes
they tryin' ta' take my only life
leave my folks on the front row
bury me in providence
heavy weight that rose
they wanna steal the bg
now tell me alton
ain't that cold
what can i do 
now what can i do to get out the game
what can i do 
now what can i do to make change
every other day around my way niggas dyin'
hours flyin i want to go straight boy i'm tryin'
  
 chorus  
i'm tryin' to shake the monkey off of me
lord please let me go where i needs to be
ball 'till i fall it's a poor family
fo' sho' i know the future got a lot of stuff for me
  
verse two: bg

i'm tryin' to get my mail straight
sell cd's and tapes
i don't want to be jail bait
niggas want to kill me
and increase the hell rate
they almost got me
but i slip the spot it was too late
i wanna be a role model for my lil' brother
and buy a fifteen room manison for my mother
settle down wit' a silent hoe 
and drop a tight seed
so i can raise another uptown bg
just like me
i'ma give 'em but i wish had a dad
he goin' be smart and bad nigga
throwin' up a solga rag
this world is kurupted
the police is crooked
my boy was runnin with a  gun
his young life they took it
this  is rotten
everyday it get's colder
they throwin' away the key
sendin' the soldiers to angoula
my round slangin' that yola
with they hand on that iron
to keep my mind right
beleive nigga i'm tryin'
  
 chorus 
  
verse three: lil' wayne

i'm tryin' to be a man at fourteen
choppin iron at fourteen'
nigga that tells my only way 
 
a lil' bity something
whuckin representin' partners
ain't to good in my neighborhood
uptowns my partner
i ain't lie i'm tryin 
to go the right way
but the night flight way
just ain't the right way
i wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live
so i choose to be a uptown hotboy hard to kill
sittin' behind the cruiser wheel 
can't even see me i'm so lil'
and you expect me to give this
just to switch to positive
as hard as i'm tryin' do it i just can't make a shape
school i'm tryin' go through it but i just can't make a shape
gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin
do good i want yeah but on half i just keep hangin'
i'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me
will i remain a bg 
or a a student
we'll see
  
 chorus  2x
uptown is my home thats where i do my dirt
i either hurt or get hurt
it's me or you on that shirt
cant let no nigga fix me
cant let no nigga get me
i'ma draw and hit first i cant let no nigga split me
had my momma upset
nigga leave my ho pussy wet
i'm goin out with a fight my chopper bullets eject 
i gets blowed and start
ready to unload at war 
no witnesses 
you cant get on the stand and say you saw nothin bout nothin
keep it shut or you dead
if you cant hush open your mouth and you'll get ten in your head
that's how i play it nigga i'll blackmail you wit you rown life
it aint right disrespect you die on site 
that aint no might that's a fact
you can believe that
instead disrespect i promise to be back
and clear the corner you cant run dont try
i'm high bout mine ready to ride or die bitch

if i could change the score we'd never hustle no more
and every bizite that i lizight 'll be like "whoa"

and the police would be for here only for the old folks
so if we have a problem we strap up and hold court

if i could change it   man if the world was mine

man we'd all have houses a half a block
we'd all be on chrome in a benz drop top

all the women would be big fine with a cute face
and the children would be the kind that stay in they place

if the world was mine i'd unite my peeps
my mom and my dad would be in this world with me

but if a nigga still trip you can hit him with glock
and just to keep it real i'll bring back biggie and pac

man we'd all get along   we'll be a family
that's just how it'll be if this world was for me

play the block all day without runnin' and duckin'
and everybody drugs raw   they don't cut it with nothin'

if i ruled the world my family wouldn't fight
everything in order   everybody all right

that sometimes i just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
and wonder what if all the shit i reaped then got repoed
and the girl i gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
see i got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
got off in the game don't need no cheat code
as long as i know the g code
being paranoid ain't turn me to a creep
you ain't got that metal on your side
police gon' work it like magneto if they need to it get deep
deep deeper than telekinesis
deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
the deeper it gets boy the pressure increases
but pressure make diamonds
and my name is sean cause i shine it's self explanatory
i architect the flow rapping all of these stories on stories
you know the story
if my back against the ropes then i'll finish don't call it
my opponent probably praying for postponement
you fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
it's written in the stars man the sky is the author
i pulled the sword out of the stone i'm king arthur
motherfuck your armor nigga only weapon i'm scared of is karma
you watching the son turn to father fucking life and her daughter
nigga that shit just get deep




been going hard all day wish a nigga would fuck with me
then i blow the candles out on my k
and niggas always thinking it's a game 'til we ran them out the arcade
stunting in my southern player reach the caddy like andre
i talk that cash money shit
ym plus cmb you can do the math for me bitch
jail time a slap on the wrist
cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
you can tell i'm grinding by my wrist
anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
well tell them i'll be waiting in suspense
i got some miles on me but it's cool cause i never get an inch
and i don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
cause shit is deep and in rap i cannot say
that shit enough times like somebody rewind me
like shit is deeper than rap i cannot say that shit enough times
i feel like sean don't get enough shine
is it because he ain't got the tattoos he ain't throwing up signs
well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
fuck the finish line just finish in lines
and if getting your point across crosses the line
some of the time then cross it with pride
that's real my nigga remember that
and ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
so just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
cause this shit is deep deep
deep as empty pockets nigga

why don't we make a mil 
rhymin' in and out of beat

if there's any beef i come ron like mercer
word up eagle street i'm throwing my curve up
we take your ice cream and turn you into sherbert
i got flow i'm like "sure" but if it's about dough i'm like "sure 'nuff"
i'm from the bird bunch birdman jr you niggaz bird lunch
i see your lips moving but i ain't heard much
you see the wirst moving it look like pure punch
i hear the playa hating but i don't endorse such
i got the escalade guts like the tour bus
i got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
and in the tires where the package is going
midas been a goodyear with these firestones
i spit like myas poems born in chromers
for the buyers chromosomes i got summers
i got vicadens valiums i ain't stopping
got pot and heroin ex oxycontin
and that's how we rocking
how can you hear that bop unless i'm be bopping
yeah skip when you hear that click
cash money nigga i'm that shit
weezy baby ugh


that's what i'm talking about
now fab spit at these niggaz
and let them know why they ain't fuckin with you


your goddamn right i'm feeling myself
a chauffeur no sir i'm wheeling myself
looking for a chick chilling for self
so i can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
i'm having problems dealing with wealth
but you wouldn't understand it until you get a million yourself
you niggaz must've got a deal for your health
your cd is frozen food it just chills on the shelf
i spend big at any time i can start splurging
the twin sigs open chests like a heart surgeon
and i'm buttoned up i'm just a blue collar crook
but i keep a stack thick as few college books
i got a new polished look
and twenty dime bitches to show y'all niggaz how my two dollars look
the boy's got at least six digits on
so the guns gotta be at least midget long
the money is like ten bridges long
i throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
i got some good smoke just for puffers
the two grand twenty's make the hustlers suffer
plus it's fluffer than a cotton ball
i've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
but nowadays you can't put it past 'em
i got a dan marino arm i'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
and the niggaz in the hood keep quoting my lines
i don't jump ship i keep floating in mine
long as i keep toting i'm fine
i'ma have these dick sucking niggaz deep throating the nine
i jumped in the english ship benzed whip
it's terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
i'm reading scripts no not the penmanship 
the box office shit  i box off this bitch 
jessica alba kirsten dunst
and still make a mil' on the first of months
these dudes be the first to front
'til they family and friends is in limos they in hearse in front
i'm in the top position i can make you a proposition
i'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
to hell with the patience
i'ma send a nigga down under like australia vacations


yeah it is what it is
my niggaz just killed y'all and i'ma close the casket
i'm tryin not to let this industry get the best of me y'all
i work hard in the game the game's stressing me y'all
all they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
from the hood to hollywood they respecting me y'all
and even overseas they accepting me y'all
all the ladies show me love the thugs repping me y'all
i get a lot of dirty money so respect me or fall
but i'm saving all my checks i'm investing 'em all
they say what goes up is gon' definitely fall
even the stars work success it's my destiny y'all
look i cook tracks i got the recipe y'all
you can't name another cat that can mess with me y'all
at the shows all the hoes be molesting me y'all
i got broads crying trying to get next to me y'all
i got broads craving begging to have sex with me y'all
screaming "cass you don't know how sexy you are"
and i'm happy i'm alive god's blessing me y'all
and all the problems that arrive is god testing me y'all
so i pray everyday but i ain't praying too much
cause i be sinning everyday so i ain't praying enough
and we all could be beat and i ain't saying i'm tough
but if it's beef i don't speak i ain't saying "what's up"
if it's beef when we meet then i'm spaying shit up
prraat prraat i ain't saying too much and that's that
cause that cat you embracing with love
might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
burn the bridge and don't give a boat let 'em sink
sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
but sometimes you gotta give 'em the nine and let 'em stink
you can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
i'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
as soon as your eyes shut them niggaz will ride up
and the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
and we all gotta die but i ain't ready to leave
that's why even if it's petty i'll be ready to squeeze
but put a cheddar in cheese the guac a moola
i pop the ruger send that hot shit through ya
like booya that's the sound when the pound busting
ooh ah you'll be laying on the ground suffering
clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
i try to only resort to violence if i have to
but man niggaz out here are playing fair
so before the odds even i'm leaving them laying there
and i ain't even playing believe what i'm saying here
cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
and found in a hole in the grass
for trying to play that thug role i'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
and this cass nigga i'm that sick
full surface nigga i'm that shit bitch
i just hope y'all niggas know
that when it's time that you niggas gotta be ready for war
you niggas gotta be prepared
you niggas gotta know that i'm serious about this shit
i'mma run 'em down nigga

i've done been used abused and accused of things that ain't true
and been told some shit about some things that ain't even new
but what i done heard is true i know y'all done heard it too

and y'all claiming that i'm the man
i got these banging ass bitches standing around with their hands out

same hoes that was talking that shit done turned groupie
i no longer have holes in my shoes i rock gucci
i know you smell the cologne
you wishing that a nigga of my caliber was taking you home
hate to intervene while i'm making you moan
when i got a little situation at hand baby i'm gone
my alarm is going off i know i been trailed

that's the reason i'm posted up here on canal
hoping you could do me and my nigga as well
call your people up we need a lot of females

get down you should ride with us on blades
i'm creeping up your block in a burban escalade
c note and juvenile and we coming through your city
looking for the fine girls with them nice titties
got a drop in the driveway rolling through the fly way
hoping that i don't spot a cop on the highway
just a few things we do on sunday
bout to turn mlk into a one way
ok i'm still smoking doja
all my niggaz screaming cloverland magnolia
best to watch your back cause we coming with them soldiers
looking for them niggaz who be snitching to them rollers

like bush do the same man i'm coming that's a fact
i got niggaz every city every state
i'm just saying ain't a few phone calls i couldn't make what


yo i write rhymes for niggas at night time
consider your life mine
whether you pumpin 5 packs or 5 dimes
my time i'm livin' it my persona eminent
real niggas don't keep beef we finish it
no retreat no surrenderin
no rockin me to sleep
i keep the heat up in my premises
a whole different level of rhyme several of my
competitors try comin better than mine
verbally i'm way ahead of my time mega
immortalized through words
son i'm livin off the time you served
stay focused keep a eye open for straight vultures
everybody gotta go everydays a day closer
i'm soakin in my sofa reminiscin tony coked up
life is fucked up even when you blow up


lil wayne: who can ya trust
mega: only a few and my nine will bust
lil wayne: what do you lust
mega: the money and the power nigga
lil wayne: who you respect
mega: all my niggas that's no longer with us
and all the drug king pins who showed us how ta get up


who's the nicest nigga spittin a trife shit
ghetto drama sagas for niggas with enditements flippin white shit
screamin fuck the feds
squeezing ya heat at police till your cuffed to your hospital bed
thug general write rhymes for criminals to listen to
if you aint real my shit aint even meant for you
my pen stain the paper like blood
my mind is like a nine and my rhyme is like a slug
before i snitch like a bitch i'd rather die like a thug
if they arraign me for bangin i throw my sign up at the judge i'm almighty
defy me feel the 44 beside me
red light to guide me to your vital point
with my heat i anoint you a second from death
my only regret is that i emptied out my whole clip in your soul biatch




to my thugs its unconditional love i'm givin you
i've been out the motha fuckin system too
hunger pains when i was younger made me ready 2 face
consequences of life the streets fed me
ready rock chop the pumped i bought my high top dunks
and crack fiends only a baby nah hold up
the sense of shit i just made up in the rhyme this is the realness
in a reflection of a sinner i spit
yo feel this my name alone had me maintainin a phone
on a come through not to mention the banger i hold
aint nothing new why would i front for you
i'm a felony offender you showin your jealousy nigga

intro :

ransom notes keep falling out your mouth

speak no feeling no i don't believe you
you don't care a bit you don't care a bit

chorus :

this is what we need you decided this
whatcha say 

verse 1 :

fuck a love song i'm lookin' for my enemies
i don't even know what the hell has gotten into me
i guess i got tired of the drama and the bullshit
finger on the trigger guarantee they never pull shit
they rap about that mob shit that's not what i'm about
i get paid to make hits they can be the hottest out
killers with no bodies will i ever blow probably
look around who can do it like me nobody
put a milli' on it i could give it to you if you really want it
put me on a song with anybody bet i  
rest in peace to the beat it's bleeding on me
on the remix with wayne i don't see opponents
if a hater want it i ain't losing to him
i call it revenge his partners call it losin' a friend
again i'm the people's hope i'm a do it for them
and do it like nobody gon' do it again 

chorus:

this is what we need you decided this
whatcha say 

verse 2 : 

 call me weezy baby 
hands up tech wavin'
hey now lay down like a nigga put a bed down
sleep tight die in a dirt cheap life
suit tucked tie and the shirt speech nice
lumps in throats trumpet blow 
where we at daddy guns and coke 
the quiet is woke the riot's provoked 
all them busters allowed me to suffer and
she know not to ever fuck around with the fuckers and
stop looking up that mountain above you
have you looking under cars inspecting mufflers
 that's reality baby check your calendar
every day's a new day and this can be the last one 
so you better make it pay off
or make a nigga scratch a day off 

chorus :

this is what we need you decided this
whatcha say

little girl gone somewhere out there stranded
can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
she was raised good can't blame her parents
lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it


well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
who on the outside had everything people wished they had
a beautiful daughter two story house two car garage
and a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
see daddy was a doctor and mommy was a banker
mommy's job got outsourced so now mommy's a dranker
daddy had a malpractice suit now he's a snorter
and all this shit is taking place right in front of their daughter
she says "daddy what's wrong"
but he's just too high
"mommy what we gon' do"
she just get drunk and cry
caught in the middle of two wrongs tryin' to do right
looking for answers alone in the darkness of night
shit ain't tight


little girl gone somewhere out there stranded
can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
she was raised good can't blame her parents
lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it


couldn't even fold her own clothes yet she chose to jet
some shit that she will always regret
now she's runnin' from house to house out and about
all hours of the night learnin' hard lessons of life
she called home twice but she couldn't say
where she was gonna' lay her head the very next day
she gave up her body and mind way before time
got nothin' left to dug out to get help


she doesn't know what to do with herself
her family's worried think she don't even care
don't even care
she's livin' a rough life on a hope and a prayer
where she'll end up in a few years who knows where
who knows where

my necklace is a crime
and that bitch fine what that girl name

and i never show my hand not even to me
see




say what's on your heart if you're real
cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal
and i used to chase money now i have it brought
cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught
if there's a summertime in hell it's not as hot
you empty clip niggaz ain't got a shot
these diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
now you decide if their to die for
advice to my haters do what i say now
report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
thought it was love how foolish of us
i do me she do her sometimes we do eachother




look as the crooked world revolves
love spelt backwards is evol 
and evil spelt backwards is live or live
and when death comes you better have lives to give
i spit that real talk like knives to ribs
and rats die ugly die with kids
these niggaz is snitching and still living
i hope my words are like razors to the bitches
niggaz pretend like they actually in
but when it go down they fuck around and be them
that blood look familiar when it's leaking
if you scared go see a deacon nigga
that ain't love




life is but a dream
ain't always what it seems
meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
hustle plus muscle equal success i did the math
i see these haters in passing yeah they 'round
i be on the way up they be on the way down
now i can sit and talk shit like skip bayless
you looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
lifestyle a list young black and famous
bunch of bad bitches in an ipod playlist
just another page in my success story
i make my worst enemies wish the best for me
heavenly father
creator of all things

heavenly father


before i sleep
i pray to the lord
for a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
for a soul to take
for goodness sake
before i sleep
i pray to the lord
for a soul to keep
and if i should die
before i wake
i pray to the lord
my soul to take


lord forgive me for the killings in the past
all the corrupt business' and dealings that i had
all these pregnant ladies that i served up on the ave
have me feel like i'm bishop when i held my first gat
they killed tom right in front of his home
they even murrked skee in my mpv
so i dropped to my knees why it couldn't be me
why you had to leave me here with all this envy
even though i got freedom i feel like i ain't free
everybody dying tryin' to be something they can't be
a couple hundred million is something we'll never see
so we speedin' crashin' head first into a tree




i paid nigga's rents even paid nigga's bails
gave niggas jobs so they wouldn't go to jail
did so much dirt niggas knew i wouldn't tell
paid for some funeral they probably went to hell
i don't owe nobody nothing man i gave that bitch a mill
i ain't beating around the bush i'm just speakin' on what's real
i ain't talkin on no bullshit man i'm talkin bout what's real
i ain't justifying beatings well she cheated on my nills
cheated with his brother god damn this bitch i'll
probably the reason my niggah left the will
things you'd never know have mercy on his soul
big pun one of the most realests i ever known




when i die know they bury me a g
don't cry for me just let a nigga be
in other words let your nigga rest in peace
i been going so hard and i barely got sleep
lord i know my mamma gunna take my passing hard
but let her know in these streets her little boy was god
last of the mohicans i was takin mothafuckas hearts
many wars you can see it in the bullet scars
lord can you forgive me for my sins
let me fly with you help a nigga spread his wings
azarya you forever be my queen
just know for now daddy had to go and meet the king

put the whole world in a casket
and i'm gon' watch this world just burn to ashes

as i watch the trees fall down to the pavement
and a breeze turn to blazes


starin' at the world through my rear view
gotta stay high just so i can keep a clear view
tryna do right but i'm swervin' in the left lane
tryna stay out of that black hole watch my step man
they say money is the root of all evil
and we love it so i guess me and you are all equal
shit ain't been the same since hurricane katrina
ike and rita what happened with the fema
government officials not keeping it official
like a ref with no whistle so i'm tackling the issues
and they wonder why we act the way we act
murder murder steal steal and sell crack to get stacks but


where's my matches where's my matches
put the whole world in a casket
and i'm gon' watch this world just burn to ashes
turn to ashes
one day this world gon' turn to ashes
and i'm a just sit back laughing
and when i tried to kick that habit
man i was like: "where's my matches where's my matches "
this whole world is aware of my actions
but they ain't that bad compared to taxes
ashes all i see is ashes
as the world burns


i'm a young arsonist on my late night johnny carson shit
i ain't never gave a fuck about the world
cause they don't give a fuck about me or my girl
or my mama in the midst of the drama ya digg
they try to pull you all the way back to get ahead of you
then internal revenue gon' come for your revenue
sayin' that you owe 33% of what you make
when the world die i'm a be rejoicing at the wake


as i watch the trees fall down to the pavement


and i'm like: "where's my matches where's my matches "
put the whole world in a casket
and i'm gon' watch this world just burn to ashes
turn to ashes turn to ashes
one day this world gon' turn to ashes
so where's my matches where's my matches
i blow the flame out the world is dark now
and everybody need their spark now
and i'm like: "where's my matches where's my matches "
put the whole world in a casket
and i'm gon' watch this world just burn to ashes
turn to ashes turn to ashes

yeah yeah
born in antagonism sometimes i can't even fathom
hopes man i don't even have 'em
burning ladders bridges
can't wait to get to a chapter where i'm laughing and living
for what i'm stuck in a  indirect precision
digging through old folders for what i feel i'm missing
this liquor nine months ago swear i'd make better decisions
i would drink by the liter of kittens
my liver bleeds while i'm checking out instead of seeing the difference
i'm  at the deceased horse leaving an imprint
while trying to beat the dead you're just feeding existence
sometimes you need to take a step back and breathe for a minute
before you overreact to the heat and intenseness
you were weak and defenseless once you preceded the limit
then it's not a scrimmage the game's to ruin your self seeking image
all the chaos in the day lies the region for tenants
you'll go to jail and pay bail then the judge reads you a sentence


hello honey i'm home
i'm kicking out the weak and the timid niggas
they keepin' it pimping weezy baby to an infant
i'm growing
you niggas snoring 'cause you sleep with the fishes
you'll be like sheep to a grizzly put my bare feet on them bitches
and i keep a bitch with me yellow as pee that i spit in
i'm a breeze to the finish and i'm a weep when i win it
i'm a sleep with the semi and never let people get near me
when the reaper come get me that's when i reap what i'm knitting
so you say you're gangsta i'm a need some convincing
blood gang creme de la creme is the crimson
fuck the pigs all day even the guineas
fuck the system pull out
and skeet on the titties
it's lil tunechi
started from a league now we swimming
put this hot red revolver to your cheek while you're grinning
i could cheat roger clemens


catch a nigga riding deep in your women
beep goes the jeep so we winning
friendless compete with no nigga but myself
white sand and the beach towels hitting
white man let my peeps outta prison
i'm just saying what i'm saying
but i'm saying i don't repeat i'm repentant
cut off the hand to hand out a sentence

my daddy was ballin' and he was the right hand man
my poppa bought us a house to keep our family secure
livin' good on a ranch in the middle of the woods
i understood at a young age my poppa would spray
seen him slit a nigga throat and shoot one up in the face
he'd be murder case after case: he was untouchable
but he had a right hand man that wasn't trustable
who undercover slow he made deals under the table
workin' for the feds 'round my people wearin' a cable
my daddy got busted so he got left with the dope
all our shit got repossessed and our family was flat broke
moved back inside the projects in summer of '84
developed my hustlin' skills from yomey and black zo
when i got to the point that i wasn't small no more
hooked up the same nigga that handled my daddy dough
i know that he sheisty; but this nigga just don't know
swear to god i ain't 'bout it; but this nigga just don't know
i got a few under my belt and i'ma make it one more
cock the 4 4 and knock his brains out on the floor

yeah young teenager 'fatuated with paper
yeah i had to get it cause momma she wasn't able
black and white tv set no cable
forties in the fridge chicken noodles on the table
i wasn't born with a silver spoon
child of the ghetto raised off a different tune
watchin' bob barker in my living room
if "the price was right" i could get you a whole living room
yeah them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days
no education but the gutter pays
through it all came a long way
from sellin' the yay' fist fights to gun play
back then


sittin' on the block and i'm doin' bad
dreaming about the things that i never had
got me thinking to myself "i gotta get it man"
you can play if you want i'm gon' get it man
i say all my life i've known
one day eventually i'll blow


yeah
times is torn as it is
that's why i got guns and my guns got kids
that's why i be goin' so tough on them hoes
i play my own hand i don't shuffle or fold
fuck wit a nigga let go fuck wit some hoes
hear them bitches screamin' like they stuck in a hole
i am not a deamon but was once a lost soul
'til i found myself a block away from the cross road
i have outgrown the fishbowl
and i'm on my feet like a fuckin insole
yeah it may hurt like a fuckin' left no
but it's "fuck the world" like a fuckin nympho
and we spend dough cause we make more
and i make sure when i say so
it's jay rock and weezy need i say more
clothesline the beat ted dibiase flow
yeah


sittin' on the block and i'm doin' bad
dreaming about the things that i never had
got me thinking to myself "i gotta get it man"
you can play if you want i'm gon' get it man
i say all my life i've known
one day eventually i'll blow


jay rock still that same og
i ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentary
everyday living tryna stay on my feet
even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets

so my family can eat i'll be damned if i see
no income here come jay rock they know crack music
drug kingpin flow oh


kingpin hoe need i say more
your family could die when i say go 
green light green light whatcha green like

yeah and i remember them long nights
livin' the wrong life but i made that wrong right

all the struggling
all it does is keep my hustling oh my


sittin' on the block and i'm doin' bad
dreaming about the things that i never had

one day eventually i'll blow
she ain't got a leg to stand on
don't even trip taha


i can take you all over the world though even tell you pack light
the last lie couldn't even get a cab ride
she don't do the blogs but if she did she'd be on mad sites
ass so mean that i'm always on her bad side
uhh now she don't ever stress me 'bout my whereabouts
never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
she mind hers it's my turn that shit she barely care about
look amazing on me why i'm always tryin to wear her out
she don't ride like you no she don't taste like that
not with a waist like that do i let her go to waste like that
she a   mix between kama sutra yoga and porno flicks
funny how her breath get shorter when i give her long dick
uhh~ and i'm tellin y'all straight up
might think i imagined shawty even when she not made up
she kill 'em in levi's see why it ain't even fair
look good in whatever she wear how could other women compare

and i know you still love me and i know it's still for me
that's why we still fuckin   cause she don't put it down like you




love bein 'round mine no downtime still nothin else even matters

whether them lights on or them lights off like i'm sleepin with the clapper
said she watchin what she eat yet that ass keep gettin fatter
how i'm sexin her makin that ex of hers no longer be a factor

these brothas try to peel my cap so i gotta put em to rest
now is it really worth the fighting and fuss
we killed one of them they killed one of us
a young teenage black male
gave em a brand new 40 and he got locked in jail
they say thats how it's supposed to be
but i don't think that kind of life was chosen for me
so i send up the sin i pray
to the lord to conversate
to end all of this hate

chorus:
living inside ghetto is not a joke not a joke
i keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
living inside ghetto is not a joke not a joke
i keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
living inside ghetto is not a joke not a joke
i keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
living inside ghetto is not a joke not a joke
i keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked


i wouldn't be alive if i didn't say

brothas in the hood ain't the same
they got a gun and they change
now they say i changed cause i'm making records
but i'm still in the hood handing out some chicken
teenage sistas getting happy drawls
used to be quiet now she do it all
it's hard to undertsand this shit
and everybody i question say "life's a bitch"
my life is a bitch because i made it that
so i'm praying to the lord please change me back

chorus


my family's not together like they should be
and i don't think they ever will be
my grandma is the only one that says she loves us
so whats the reason for the everyday scream fuss
daddy just got killed last week
for my boy on the curb may he rest in peace
then they went and killed teck
now i'm thinking "is the juv next"
i don't wanna run when i can't hide
lord if i go just make sure i'm on your side

get gorilla with it get gorilla with it
get gorilla with it get gorilla with it
get gorilla with it get gorilla with it
get gorilla with it get gorilla with it


i see you watchin how the boy comes to grover
and you wanna overthrown him knock him off his throne
your potnahs rockin with you 'til they find out who it is
then they gon' try to convince y'all to leave it alone
i'm here to sabotage what enemies accomplish
they're not about the camouflage the homies that i ride with
i keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
i don't vouch for nobody i just make sure i pay homage
hey shorty this nigga here's a vet like shaq
i don't have to control the ball but i control that rap
if i smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back
they like it when a gangster take control like that
she feels protected when she in that lexus
givin me head got me takin all wrong exits
i'm not the people you should be upset with
i don't mean no harm baby and i'm not sexist

  


a gangsta still fightin charges but he totes that glock
like a junkie with a pipe up in the smoke crack spot
i be in every hood see i knows the block
from watts to one fo' fifth by the clothing shops
nope i ain't rockin with them boys i was with
but i'm still blingin and showin off my toys in this bitch
when a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
tell us who they really is and give y'all different names
claimin she ain't nuttin like them boys be sayin
shit i'm only tryin to knock the pussy outta the frame
look here i tried to chill but they gave me some mills
me and mannie back at it 'bout to get another deal
i got my hand wrapped around the steerin wheel
hoes like ewww they can't understand the grill
skip called me up he got them all on chill
well let's go and get us some hoes so we can do this heah y'know

  
dis rain 'sposed to drop when i first hit the block
niggaz wasn't really feelin me then 
i had a little drama i was bout that there
that's how a nigga kept his name in the wind 
i'm from the projects as in the 3rd ward
as up in uptown ah what you heard of it goes
 put your trigger fingers up i'm from around the way it goes
 put your trigger fingers up i'm from around the way it goes


i got ghosts on my team unseen
and they only be ridin with me 'til we do one thing
the watch the bling bling fuck what you heard
i ain't even gotta tell 'em nothin to give 'em the word
put bosses on injured reserve fuck losses
put your sister brother mammy and your pa on the curb
i can make an ounce out of a quarter of a bird
introduce you to the killers all my dogs in the 3rd
know that this ain't the spot to sco' at
cause you don't know if nigga really got a package or he's scopin to jack
if they get'cha won't nobody rat
these families been here for years with kids and they not about to demolish that
we got  and a lot of crack
clearin our tracks cause fiends could be givin 'em a whole lot of facts
my lil' spot where it was poppin at
standin in the court all day thinkin of ways to get out of that




storm with me waitin on mignon and iggy
and this one gon' be out'chea in a minute ya hear me
hoe listen watch them niggaz let me do me
they gon' spin the bend right now they know we on duty
i got my lil' cutey i took her from hard times
go 'head hand me the strap when these niggaz get out of line
i ain't tryin to size the beef up or measure it
but i'm know in your place's where you motherfuckers better get
we ain't gotta go back and forth people to settle this
x juvey out just handle business for terius
i'm conan wild wod' i'm glowanchardo
run up like a stupid and get thrown in the pile hoe
you don't see me with no bodyguards probably in exotic cars
gettin the 411 from a lot of broads
you can get this money with me you ain't gotta starve
you my people with this business so i got a job




yeah i'm focusin on learnin from all your mistakes now
was a face in the crowd i'm a baller with grace now
i miss illegal shit but i don't fuck with the cops
cause i'm always smokin some killer when i cut through the blocks and stop
'fore i ignore it my name be in all type of shit
trippin over my car and i don't even like the bitch
niggaz get that false courage and buck
but you ain't doin shit unless the murder rate raise up
lil' wonder youth symbol stand for two k's up
it ain't your motherfuckin business about who pays us
projects know you got some change on ya it' sa shame on ya
i'm fresh out of the shootin range with my aim on ya
i heard 'em say they catchin feelings now cause i'm boss
well put your drawers in your booty bitch and break to the north
what nigga i ain't feelin nothin and i ain't fearin none
this is the magnolia and see where this guerilla from 
you put the coke in a tube and whaddya get
whatever you want a car to the flip of your wrist
drug traffickin been happenin since seventy six
they lock us up cause government be wantin tax from the shit
i call my people in detroit they get that 9 1 1
hoe gon' put it in her pussy and come flyin with son
and it's plenty full so he gonna consignment some
same nigga that i be gettin the lime ah from
got yay too how you want it soft piece or hard piece
work ain't movin i'll break it down in a heartbeat
i'm tryin to put the new 25's on my rover
so when i hit the lakefront they gotta slide over
yeahhh these hoes be respctin my cars
when i pass they smile and start adjustin they bras
niggaz peep hard and get to twistin they lips
but they could easily meet god so homey don't even trip


ridin with the strap on my lap other one in the dash
on the way to drop this nigga off a fo' and a half
last time he put my shit on his tongue
he frowned up cause the boy was numb
can you break a brick down i can break a brick down 
i can break a brick down but i prefer to sellin it whole


i read the paper today and everything was kinda chill
word is circulatin niggaz is tryin to find a deal
so he could ride behind the wheel
of the 300 and put the dub deuces in the grill
you think you can't get killed me neither
that's why we almost forced to keep heaters
a quick ruckus if a bitch touch us
ain't got no beef with no muslims but move or you get hit brother
these streets move forward and backwards
these fiends out'chea somethin more than just actors
one nigga get popped another fo' get a package
watchin out for the law man patrollin the action
what next we tryin to bring it back to the team
let our dogs see how it is to do your own thing
not like baby though really put your own bling
you ain't doin nuttin for me nigga do your own thing




g shit to 'em i don't just write rhymes
goin platinum offa talkin about my lifetimes
i'm gettin love in these streets cause they like how i rock
i'm just a thug on the beat fuck a hip hop cop
not jumpin on the bandwagon to get my props
got somethin happenin fo' me right within my block
now everybody wanna be the king of somethin
i guess i'll just call myself the king of hustlin
i make things happen nigga i'm a panhandler
shit not like how it's lookin on camera
won't exercise the right to put the bandana up
and nobody gon' handle us we never put they hammers up
you couldn't make it where i survive
right now my city murder rate is at it's all time high
and it's a must i have the piece in sight
when i'm drivin know i'm showin them no teeth just eyes



   second half only minus last half of last line
"said the ladies they love me they love the way i be leanin"
"they love the way i be leanin they love the way i be leanin"
"all the ballers is bouncin they love the way i be leanin"
"they love the way i be leanin they love the way i be leanin"


this is the year of the u watch how i get on track
a young black paid man in the rap gettin his snaps
and also he only rides in the year that he's in
cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him so let the boy be
he off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
bitches watchin him thinkin "what if he wife me"
and it's a certain kind of swagger you get
especially when you're used to bein the shit that's if you're older right
all of my boss bitches know the type
when a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin like a motorbike
a nice fit and video on the tv'll
get her to come out of them bb's believe me
i'm a thug and i'ma stay on pub'
and i don't bug cause i carry the strap in the club
i see ya peepin tryin to figure out what's happenin with us

first verse:

i went through with the plan now the man sendin' me grams
my coke organization still infestin' the land
no joke built my mama an estate in the bahamas
crops of marijuana protected by big timers
hand full of ice it's gangsta's paradise
expensive merchandise i had to sacrifice for the glamourous life
don p for breakfast benz stretches and lexus
distribution of coke from louisiana to texas
some fabricated but fascinated by the way that i made it
now my name is implicated with the greatest
wearin' the latest leather fatigues and bbh
brand new mercedes parked in front of my new estate
twelve o' clock we gave him caviar is what we ate
party with killas paraphrenalia full of projects
dope snorters or prospects the rob your shop necks
but i gets pissed and send hits don't fuck with my shit
wig split the heel whoever he roll with
admit it you did it tongue too tied  well say somethin'
nine's bustin' bringin' your platoon to destruction
continue to hustlin' givin' up nothin' where the dope at
crackers can get the bauds at because i'm pro black
think i'm a foreigner he wasn't holdin' up his side of his deal
alien gotta be killed sent to the coroner
i'm sure he would have gone before the judge
with somethin' concrete to send me cuz
he was holdin' a grudge fuckin' over a thug
told my bitch i want him dead
bring me his head fill him with lead
heard what i said  don't betray me
i'll put you on the streets and make you weak
with carrots and stones up on  fingers and your teeth
and built you a home next to the beach
and luxury cars we creep
here's the nine i don't have time make it discreet

chorus:

money on the couch nigga
gimme everything i'll pay your house nigga
shut'cha mouth nigga
put the money on the couch nigga
gimme everything i'll pay your house nigga
shut'cha mouth nigga
put the money on the couch shut'cha mouth nigga

second verse:

i know that my cousin lil' kerzaw
he sold up outta his backyard
and sold up shit from the seventeen all the way up to the ninth ward
you know he rolls up in the caddy
it's about that time to go roasts and vogue
i'ma go on the passenger side fuckin' with every last hoe
nigga russ was up in that car shop
ready to get all the seats fixed
let me go scope me a kneefit so i can go out to the freaknik
shit i'm the lyrical genius
drop down on your knees to the penis
the nigga be talkin' the shit about my family but i never did seen it
i'm larger than large if you came home with two heroin charges
and i still got somethin' stashed in the garages
y'all is petty it's gone take two to fill my stamina
when i pass the camera flash fuck the amateurs
ya better be top notch or i'ma cock my rhyme glock
to wound ya and paint your death with my autograph on your tumor

chorus

third verse:

i'm straight from the ghetto the mac they make the foes shake
then i left that spot and i went to the t where the triflin' hoes play
they comin' to me and they blowin' that funky fire
i'm grabbin' a beer and them blunts be gettin' me higher
due to my clique i walked to the front door
hope it ain't them po po's
i looked through the blinds it went through my mind
"what i have to run for"
nobody would want to test me
especially comin' to arrest me
old body and soul it's a must i leave you cold
keep it chilly chilly when i'm jigglin' jigglin' money
some niggas say okay but you can say no way
i'm drinkin' for honey
if i wouldn't be kickin' these rhymes so funky
you and your crew would never have bought my shit like junkies
a part of a "ki" is all that i need
to get on my feet up outta the weed
the capital "c" i do it for weed and even a "g" for slangin' them kis
i'm puttin' in it your face juvenile lookin' for a bitch now
don't have no time for no foreplay i'm simply gonna lay this dick down
niggas be comin' with dope lines
gimme the chance i'ma flow mine
i'm tearin' this bitch up in no time
no fuckin' ya up cuz you know i'm
funky like a club that's filled up with fat men fartin'
and never a bad thought in my mind cuz i'm steadily plottin'

chorus
i strike a load you get served i ain't to be joked with
fake buster get smoked with you provoke it
i explode it unload it reload it unload again and
put another clip in 50 shots to win i can't lose its impossible
plus i got a chopper 50 shots bout to be droppin' you
i be bout straight hittin' the beef kicker the set then
leave the set and leave a beef kicker wet
jet off the scene with the uptown fighters
red dot sighers all week night flighters
i'ma get 'cha when ya least expect it
cock the glock check it a vase can't protect it boy
is ya ready i leave yo set wetty
slugs flyin' high got ya body real heavy

left wet on the set tell yo boys to pick ya up
out cold head swole eyes drove
i know fa'sho you ain't gone test me no more
yo block tore yo family in black clothes
you got blowed and in yo chest is many holes
this goes a lot of rounds of ammo
i show how uptown niggas drove
ya fake boy me and my niggas did it to ya
automatic black chopper trigger pullers
that's how we be loadin' clips then release
eight deep in the 300 e leather seats and in the trunk atiliary

i'm polverizin' niggas pullin' k f's with two triggers
on my body theres a side of me

them demons got me on a flight
duck tape'n and takin' life or even worse
it could be three o'clock on a sunday by church
yo brains i'ma have to burst
you shouldn't have fucked with me first
gettin' full of some malcolm adams apple i scalp 'em
got richard penatin callin' for national guards to come help him
very seldom when ya see when you do what do you do
bust back better be a head shot if not then it's through
i'm comin' around the corner bout to pull a meatball on ya
fully dressed like a hoe and in my purse is a calico
me and lil turk if you heard of a merger on a murder
50 g'z on his head what the fuck did you say
50 g'z fa'sho that nigga live next door
call the man give him a rang left the sucker change
look i fuck with that rap shit but acts a donkey on the low

and if you cross my line then you will get served
i win lose or die this happens everyday
muthafuckas get killed in this game i play
i put these hands on a nigga cuz he talk too much

when i confronted this nigga he got highly upset
took off his shirt booted up then looked down to my chest
so i slammed his ass the nigga started to kick
i went to stompin' in his face fuckin' up his shit
gave him a good ass whippin' then i started to steppin'
i saw him reachin' in his pants i seen he was stressin'
the niggas was stuntin' but i had mine
five times through the chest family outside cryin'
on the way back home i saw this sharp ass lady
polo down hair fixed and some gold earrings
i asked just where she's headed she said "7th ward"
release the fine bitch out the st bernard
she hopped in the ride i take the hoe to popeye's

the hoe got full we went to the rochambeaux
took off her clothes and bust three nuts and after that i was through
took her halfway home and told the bitch "get on"

that we did it before yeah we did it before
shit i wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
that we did it before yeah we did it before

verse 1:
okay put your hands up if you did it before
now your girl lookin' at you cause she didnt hell know
and now everybody sayin' that you did it before
and you know that's because that they did it before
'cause if they did it before it would be different though
i wonder if tammy knows that i did it before

verse 2:
yeah so if you did it before be a pro
you gotta act like you did it before
and everytime i meet a girl
they say that she did it before
you know i gotta act like i never did it before
but she be deep cover if she didn't hell know
cause i did it before and she will be dumb
if she think that i didn't hell know
that she did it before she probablly didn't go low
so we did it some more and we did it some more
like busta rhymes said she holla give me some more
so we did it some more yeah we did it til' four

wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
that they did it before like they didnt below
or if they did it with more yeah if they did it for dough
well if you didn't then so be cool with it and flow

what are you asking if i don't have the answer
it's probably on the web like i'm a damn tarantula
but i know you don't understand cuz you thought lil wayne is weezy
but weezy is dwayne


i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


i was watching tv the other day right
got this white guy up there talking about black guys
talking about how young black guys are targeted
targeted by who america
you see one in every 100 americans are locked up
one in every 9 black americans are locked up
and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
the money we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
a young motherfucker to jail
would be less to send his or her young ass to college
see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack/cocaine stuff like that
meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine
police are only i don't want to say only right but shit
only logic by riding around in the hood all day
and not in the suburbs
because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where i'm going
but why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court
cuz this drug ain't that drug you know level 3 level 4 drug shit like that
i guess it's all a misunderstanding
i sit back and think you know us young motherfuckers you know that 1 in 9
we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
and it's not like in the suburbs we don't have what you have
why i really don't wanna know the answer
i guess we just misunderstood huh
you know we don't have room in the jail now
for the real motherfuckers the real criminals
sex offenders rapists serial killers
don't get scared don't get scared
i know you saw one them sex offenders papers
don't trip he live right on the end of yo block
mhm yea that nigga live right down the street from you
sex offender on the level 3 drug
convicted ex con
yea check em out
watch you got you got a daughter son what you got
haha yea you know what
that's the good weed
you know what i have a fucking daughter
you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
just because the reason why he live next door to me
ain't the reason i live next door to him
meaning he didn't wrap his way to my fucking neighborhood
he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
you move him out bring him to jail for life
and then you move in with a sex offender
ahaha hey give me a paper
ahaha is that a misunderstanding because i didn't understand it
another thing let me take my glasses off
cause i wanna see the reaction on there faces when i say this
ha ha uh mr al sharpton
here is why i don't respect you and nobody like ya
see you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
that's not good no homo
rather unhuman i should say
i mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
rather to me is helping one another
no matter your color or race
but this guy and people like him theyd rather speculated before they inflamate
if that's a word ha hahaha you know spec before check
anyways meaning id much rather
you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton
hold on i ain't finished with you man
na fuck that shit mhm hold on um
mr sharp ton and anyone like you you don't know me
so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
are what ever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost
to me and it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise
doesnt
necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics for
heavenly into bads way ahaha but since i am human i am good and bad as
well but i try my hardest to stay good
threes other things i do and say may be bad or just not to good
but i do try so with that said i don't vote you i mean your only human good or bad
but i also don't respect you and i don't care if that's good or bad
you
see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me
your just another don king with a perm hahaha just a little more
political and that just means you're a little unhuman
then use humans and now let me be human and say
fuck al sharpton and anyone like him
fuck if you understand me
i love being misunderstood
haha why
cause i live in the suburbs
but i come from the hood
bring the hook in
 wheres my coffee
 good morning dr carter
 hey sweetie
 looks like it's gonna be a long day
 uhhh another one huh what we got
 your first patient 
 yeah
 is suffering from a lack of concepts
 uh huh
 originality
 ugghh
 his flow is weak
 another one
 and he has no style
 ugghhh
 what you got for him
 tssss okay


let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on
dr carter to the rescue
excuse me if i'm late but like a thief it takes
time to be this great uhhh so just wait
your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place
and i'm just grace one uno ace
and i'm tryna make your heart beat like bass
hmm mm but you're sweet like cake
and i come to fix whatever you shall break
where is your originality you are so fake
so picture me like a gallery capture what i say
all i need is one mic all i need is one take
like hey brighter than the sun ray
got a pistol on a playground watch the gunplay
like no kidding no kids in the way
but the kids do watch gotta watch what we say
gotta work everyday gotta not be clichéd
gotta stand out like andre 3k
gotta kick it kick it like a sensei 
you gotta have faith you gottta gotta
wait wait i think i i think i lost him



 good afternoon dr carter
     i don't know about this one
     his confidence is down vocab and metaphors needs work
     and he lack respect for the game
 uhhhh let me see
 you think you can save him


okay respect is in the heart so that's where i'ma start
and a lot of heart patients don't make it but hey kid
plural i graduated
'cause you can get through anything if magic made it
and that was called recycling re: reciting something 
'cause you just like it so you say it just like it
some say it's biting but i say it's enlightening
besides dr kanye west is one of the brightest
and dr swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
and dr jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
arthritis in my hand from writing
but i'm a doctor they don't understand my writing
so i stopped writing now i'm like lightning
and you ain't vince young so don't clash with the titan
fast and exciting my passion is frightening
now let me put some more vocab in your iv
here take this vicodin like it and love it
and confidence has no budget
so pay me no mind
i don't walk it like i talk it 'cause i run it
i don't do it 'cause i done it
and i'm in the emergency on it
god dunnit i've lost another one



 good evening dr carter it's been a long day
     but this one looks much better than the others
     his respect is back up concepts sound good
     his style is showing strong signs of improvement
     all he needs now is his swagger
 okay let me take my gloves off then


swagger tighter than a yeast infection
fly go hard like geese erection
flashing patrol police detection
eyes stay tight like chinese connection
eyes stay tight like pussy at night
baby don't get me wrong i can do that pussy right
but i'm too wrong to write too fresh to fight
too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle
had to say it twice swagger so nice
and don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
and i don't rap fast i rap slow
'cause i mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes
swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat
wait as i put the light down his throat
i can only see flow his blood starting to flow
his lungs starting to grow this one's starting to show
strong signs of life where's the stitches here's the knife
smack his face his eyes open i reply what a night
welcome back hip hop i saved your life


 he looks good his vitals are up 
     he's looking good he's looking good
     i think we got one dr carter i think we got one
     yep yep we got one we saved him he's good
     he's good we got one he's good
     
     he's good we got him 
     we saved him he's a go he's good

hah these niggas is nuts
man that m 14 leave you physically fucked
hah these niggas is ducks
well you could call me scrooge cause i'm swimming in bucks
bitch




ok yeah yeah
too hot too cold
i'm i'm red hot blue cold yeah
i knock ya melon out ya fruit bowl
all my guns black i got truth sold yeah
and i call my coup a black panther
"blat blat blat" that's the gat anthem
and if a nigga play with family for that matter
i'ma smoke so many niggas i'ma catch cancer yeah
and if i step up out this benzo
you know i'm coming with a gun like a nintendo
they soft them niggas falling when the wind blow
then i'm rolling up my window fuck 'em


we are at war with the universe the sky is falling
and the only thing that can save us now
is sensitivity and compassion


daa da da da da da daa da da
daa da da da da da daa da da


but i know one thing's for sure
i'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down


yeah
some say tragedy's hard to get over
but sometimes that tragedy means it's over
soldier from the academy league of rollers
i deny being down though they seem to hold us
my shoulders are strong i prove 'em wrong
i ain't doing nothing but moving on
let the truth be known
but they talked that freedom at us
and didn't even leave a ladder damn


i work at the corner store
we all got problems problems
no one's gonna fly down low
no one's gonna save us now 
how you feel you're not alone
we're all just jealous jealous
we don't reach the sky no more
we just can't overcome no


you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad
what is my destiny
you tie my hands what i am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad
what am i gonna be


i knock on the door hope isn't home
fate's not around the lucks all gone
don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right
and i'ma tell you what's life and did you know
i lost everything but i ain't the only the one
first came the hurricane then the morning sun
excuse me if i'm on one
and don't trip if i light one i walk a tight one
they try tell me keep my eyes open
my whole city underwater some people still floatin'
and they wonder why black people still voting
'cause your president still choking
take away the football team the basketball team
and all we got is me to represent new orleans shit
no governor no help from the mayor
just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer


these friends they come and go
but i got family family
these kids so fast they grow
they learn so quickly now
that there's nowhere to go
that there's no future future
don't make this here so low
and we can't overcome no




and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
just breathe baby god's got a blessing to spare
yes i know the process is so much stress
but it's the progress that feels the best
'cause i came from the projects straight to success and you're next
so try they can't steal your pride it's inside
then find it and keep on grinding
'cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
i know


yeah yeah yeah
see right now we just riding on love
a shot in the dark
we ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
we need love
that's all y'all that's all

x2

yeah born right here in the usa
but due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
so accept my emotion
do not take it as an offensive gesture
it's just the epitome of my soul
and i must be me
we got spirit y'all we got spirit
we got soul y'all we got soul
they don't want us to see but we already know

so misunderstood but what's a world without enigma
two bitches at the same time synchronized swimmers
got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
never met the bitch but i fuck her like i missed her
life is the bitch and death is her sister
sleep is the cousin what a fuckin family picture
you know father time and we all know mother nature

no matter who's buyin i'm a celebration
black and white diamonds fuck segregation
fuck that shit my money up you niggaz just honey nut
young money runnin shit and you niggaz just runner ups
i don't feel i done enough so i'ma keep on doin this shit
lil tunechi or young tunafish




yeah i'm goin back in okay
i lost my mind it's somewhere out there stranded
i think you stand under me if you don't understand me
had my heart broken by this woman named tammy
but hoes gon' be hoes so i couldn't blame tammy
just talked to moms told her she the sweetest
i beat the beat up call it self defense
swear man i be seein through these niggaz like sequins
niggaz think they he men pow pow the end
talkin to myself because i am my own consultant
married to the money fuck the world that's adultery
you full of shit you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
young money eating all you haters do is add salt
stop playin bitch i got this game on deadbolt
mind so sharp i fuck around and cut my head off
real nigga all day and tomorrow
but these muh'fuckers talkin crazy like they jaw broke
glass half empty half full i'll spill ya
try me and run into a wall outfielder
you know i'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
the fruits of my labor i enjoy 'em while they still ripe
bitch stop playin i do it like a king do
if these niggaz animals then i'ma have a mink soon
tell them bitches i say put my name on the wall
i speak the truth but i guess that's a foreign language to y'all
and i call it like i see it and my glasses on
but most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
satisfied with nothin you don't know the half of it
young money cash money
paper chasin tell that paper look i'm right behind ya
bitch real g's move in silence like lasagna
people say i'm borderline crazy sorta kinda
woman of my dreams i don't sleep so i can't find her
you niggaz are gelatin peanuts to an elephant
i got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
yeah with a swag you would kill for
money too strong pockets on bodybuilder
jumped in a wishin well now wish me well
tell them kiss my ass~ call it kiss and tell


yeahhhhh
word to my mama i'm outta my lima bean
don't wanna see what that drama mean get some dramamine
llama scream hotter than summer sun on a ghana queen
now all i want is hits bitch wayne signed a fiend
i i played the side for you niggaz that's tryin to front and see
son of gunz son of sam you niggaz the son of me
pause for this dumber speech i glow like buddha
disturb me and you'll be all over the flow like luda'
bitch i flow like scuba bitch i'm bold like kiva
and i keep a killer hoe she gon' blow right through ya
i be macking 'bout my stackin and now i pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backin out on behalf of my shooter
niggaz think they high as i i come laugh at your ruler
cash money cold bitch but our actions is cooler
wayne these niggaz out they mind
i done told these fuck niggaz so many times
that i keep them bucks steady on my mind
tuck these i fuck these on your mind pause
to feed them on my grind did i get a little love
keep throwin my sign in the middle
hit 'em up piece on my side
cause ain't no peace on my side   bitch~
i'm a man i visit urinals abroad
tune tell me to i'm shootin when the funeral outside




i'm uptown thoroughbred a bx nigga ya heard
gunna 
i see you with your palms in your pants 
but me me see me i got the world in my hands 
i make it spin on my finger 
i'm a critical thinker 
i'm a hell of a smoker and a bit of a drinker 

 
i know your name yeah 
your name is unimportant
we in the belly of the beast 
and she thinkin bout abortion 

 
i woke up this morning dick rock hard 
ashed my blunt in my grammy award 
you can save your bullshit on your memory card 
if this real nigga business then you niggas unemployed 
jumped on the celly called makaveli 
he says he was gravy i say i was jelly 
looked in the mirror said "you's an ill nigga" 
then i ran to the money like track and field nigga
now i think i'll have me a coffee with six sugars 
in a world full of ass kissers and dick pullers 
i'm tryin to walk a straight line but the line crooked 
i'm shootin for the stars astronauts dodge bullets 
yeah i bought a brand new attitude 
the haters music to my ears i got my dancin shoes 
sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to 
but i just built a house on "i don't give a fuck" avenue 

 

 

 
down on the ceiling lookin up at the bed 
life is a gamble better check the point spread 
and when life sucks i just enjoy the head 
i'm so sick of these niggas i need meds 
smokin on a hallelujah thank you jesus 
help me focus on the future and not the previous 
double r i'm a rebel with a reason 
sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon 
blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees 
underground shit i see myself as a seed 
livin in the glass and everybody's lookin
but how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it 
this current affairs but who the hell cares 
everybody's fightin over positions musical chairs 
on the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs 
i'm just fuckin ready so i come prepared 

 

 
and if i could sweat glare the bombs burstin in air
life is a roller coaster but still unfair
a blessing in disguise its right before our eyes
but since it is in disguise we don't know that its there

 

i know your name
i live it up like these are my last days
if time is money i'm an hour past paid
ughh gunpowder in my hourglass
niggaz faker than some flour in a powder bag
yeah i put it down like my hands hurtin
i'm on a natural high but i land perfect
some of us are lovers most of y'all haters
but i put up a wall and they just wallpaper
so love or hate me i stay hate free
they say we learn from mistakes that's why they mistake me
i got some weight on my shoulders to me it's like feathers
all hail weezy call it bad weather
i stick to the script i memorize the lines
'cause life is a movie that i've seen too many times
you're on the outside lookin in close the blinds
and they say never say never but fuck it never mind
i've been gone too long
true or false right or wrong

you never credit yourself so when you got older
it's seems like you came back ten times over
now you're sittin here in this damn corner
lookin through all your thoughts and lookin over your shoulder

to be the one here talkin to me be the one listenin but

no tricks man those is for kids
kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
you fuckin with pa so you know what it is 
i'm sittin on the fours that clack
comin down candy in the golden lac
we gettin to the money like it's goldman sachs
and we do it for the pimps that are holding back let's go 


look who crept in with automatic weapons reppin qb till the death of him
thatnigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like kanye west and em
track record goes back to the essence
smack adolescents who ask who the best is
i'm nasty like gas from a fat man attested
i pass it you gaspin for breath and you die fast
but i'm like a gastronomic bypass
bunch of nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
since sixteen i ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow cocaine white range rov'
tats on my body like an art exhibit i did real good for a project nigga
was once a bacardi sipper now it's chandon fat blunts in the car with strippers
guns in compartments hidden i was real young look at youth a novice nigga
blessings bowed down respected chowed down now my food's digested
pow pow with my shooters are techs bust louder than the noise that i just spit
let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin testin
chop heads off like king henry the eighth guillotine to ya neck bitch~
i'm a king in this thing don't be dumb
been in this shit since '91
niggaz can't fuck with the style i use
your fate is sealed no heidi klum

they actin like they ain't gon' die until i let them llamas fly
flatbush to bed do or die from watts to larry hoover chi
poverty and heroine it's no place for a juvenile
greed in our heart it's the green that we want
cash money is the company and weezy the boss 


they say i'm underrated  but un compete with able
understandable being that my rating levels are unreachable
anything said other than that should be silenced unspeakable
and the thought of you being nicer than me unfeasible
they ask is what i do ever gonna stop this shit will never end
that's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin
"there he goes again"
see now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
now let me dominate it nigga run
and they be knowin that i be blackin on everything
and make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
i gotta make it what they want and wake em when i come and shake em
and bake em and take em to another place
ain't no fakin ain't no kind of mistakin how i be breakin up
everything and be creating a s s s situation when i'm done

to keep it under control

and your well on your way to the top

and we keep the hustlin' slick and got clips like bananas
we twist the bandanas and spit at niggas with cannons
we ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
stormin' through the house screamin' "where's this bastard's crack"
i flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
like "slut where's the yay or i'ma pop one in your grill"
it's lil wayne nigga   blast and bang triggas
pay with my change then i'm gon' have to bang niggas
i bag the caine quicker and sprinkle like rain nigga
flood the av quick with the quarters and halves nigga
if you out you can find me on the street with the work
if it's a drought you can find me on the street with the work
never slip   i empty half a clip deep in your shirt
and put your whole clique deep in the dirt

see we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em
and when it comes down to drugs i'm on the streets with 'em

how come these niggaz keep burnin the world
and why the hell this nigga wheezy keep firmin your girl

then i'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
when you see them bullets that my glock pop y'all gon' eat 'em

and they gon' either get it right or they get it at night
and when they spit it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
henny and ice is what i prefer but light on the rocks
i pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your block
and if there's coke involved then your throat's involved
i get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
me and my nigga super sosa run up in your crib
while your grandma watchin oprah jag her up and rope her
if you wan' grudge chances slim like ethiopia
if you want drugs i got more flavors than fruitopia

wheezy whee 
watch out 
age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this 
cas i think i speak for every one when i say life is a bitch 
i ride d l into the c l gun right in my grip 
i slip a clip in every rip  cas hatas likely to trip 
come home to my future wife and every nite she'll flip 
she end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit 
but i like when we split drink henney without ice when i'm pissed 
go to the club and start a fight thinkin i'm tyson and shit 
but i'm a man so i'm here to handle my situtions correctly 
and i noi might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me 
but in the mean partner i'm fightin gun charges in court 
and in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start 
its like i'm livin happy now 
except for the fact my daughter sayin i love you daddy now 
and that kinda juice me up and i smoke about 3 blunts 
and puff a cooler bust me up 
and say a prayer for everyday 
just so i get through the stuff but i be like 

   2x 
ahhhh man it's complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man 
and when u feel like everythang is goin wrong man
i'm gone stand cause i am a grown man 


i try to keep my head up but i die to keep my bread up 
and usually i'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up 
but i get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts 
and i get hit up with all kinda stress 
and put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough 
but i mantain to climb through it all
and i still manage to be lil wayne therefore i shine and i ball 
and dawg i live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow 
and i borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall 
and i'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution 
and someway i still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion 
and i don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it 
cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me 
so if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit 
and plus i know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest 
and i ain't neva said they don't appreciate what i do 
but jus know if i wasn't a man i wouldn't make it through 

   2x 


who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic 
but i chose my own life so i gradually accept it
i'm influenced and effected by the way it became 
and i don't play with them at all so i don't say its a game 
and even though i grew up hard and i have gracefully change 
i'm always street so i'll forever be facin a change 
and i'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants 
and i demand respect from all if not then i'm waisten a man 
and if i want it then i get and if i need it i have it 
take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit 
and i'm so often i'm congratulated for the succeced at last 
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leadin my path 
and i didn't ask for you to like me i don't care if you hate me 
but don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me 
now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell i'm gone 
and i dawg i do believe i'm grown 
so i'll be good on my own but i be like 

 fadingbelieve dat

you've been brave never lettin it show
always tryin to keep it under control 
you got it now and weather your way to the top 
but there's somethin that you forgot
 

you forgot about the house you forgot about the ring
i remember everythin i just wanna hear you sing
i remember the love right after the fight
you can't tell me you don't remember those nights
and if i would cry then you would cry twice
to me you are the brightest star and the sunlight

you give back my girl then you give me back my life
give back my girl then you give me back my life

open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight
i remember the time i wish i could bring it back

but i know you know
i know you do
but i wish you and yours nothin but happiness shorty
 

but i hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin sportscenter
you were cookin dinner i was such a sinner
but the lord is a forgiver you know they say if you pray
then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
and your boyfriend is not like me
ma you even went and got a tan drop like me
i remember we was in that home all day
you called me butter i called you bay
my mama asked about ya my partners did too
i know your daughter will be so amazin like you
and i know you probably wish you never met me
and i just wish you never forget me
and let me say please don't worry about the women i've been with
no engagement can amount to your friendship
and i hope that nigga know he got a queen
and all i can do is dream damn

so now i must make it happen
so i'm a play the captain
sail boat flapping
my nigga
no fingers i'm snapping
happy for my nigga lil tagus
cause even though we couldnt
the lord saved him
last time we seen him was when katrina hated
shhh found his body like a month later
rest in peace boy
he was a east boy
and so was wessy west
he was a good nigga so i know he bless
and his daughter is a princess
this shit is harder than a bench press
but let me keep going
but i swear i got a lump in my throat
but i'm a keep on pumping the flow
so if i cry don't stop the beat
i feel like my heart just stopped the beat
my nigga lil derek was quick to cop a key
either that or load the gat and go pop a g
and because of that
he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
i pray his family in his momma's fine
so much shit just sit on this mind to mine
i think about it all the time
i drink about it all the time
i smoke back to back
cause if my thoughts got to me i'd be in this rap
or i'll be in a can
thank god i had dreams of being a man
yeah
and fuck a man with a badge
cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
the 5 0 killed naudy the good boy dead
man you would've thought they killed cornbread
shot him up face down on the lawn
not to mention wit his handcuffs on
not to mention they had plain clothes on
and the complaint goes on
but nobody do nothing about it
the jail house and the morgue is to fucking crowded
and hate is at an all time high
everybody gotta hater like a fucking ipod
shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
but i got my gun licenses
i got my hammers up
i'm ready to shoot like a ca me ra
stay still motherfucker
i'm a have to write my will this summer
cause if they don't kill me
i'm a kill this summer
yea
and you can put that on my late father
or my late grandmother miss mercedes carter
or my grandfather larry balsock
the old man hustled till his heart stopped
and i know that my real pops had money
no bank account that brown paper bag money
yea he might hit me off with a little brag money
but that nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
but look how i turned out i hope he glad for me
but that's why when i see him i acts mad funny
cause he a joke to me
don't message don't call
don't talk to me
it's just me and my momma
how it suppose to be
and i make sure she paid like she wrote for me
and i know she gets all hope from me
and i don't never wanna see her mope for me
hopefully
but truthfully
there is a day that's due for me
but we gone pray that it's as far as the future sees
you are listening to the future weezy f baby amen

cause every hit record's been instant like replays
hold the line i got yo' momma on 3 way
tell her luda's got mo' records than the dj
tell her she should blow me like candles on yo' b day
cause i've signed mo' lines than she's passed on the freeway
mo' checks than you ever could imagine
mo' wood up in my whip than in a forest full of cabins
and yes i stay high on that purple like aladdin
and women say i talk mo' game than john madden
how'd it happen how'd they let me in the booth
how they let these rappers lie how dare i tell the truth
i'm the truth and these other boys phony
it's a movie so act like you know me

 
i'm a lyricist to the death so i got what you need
ludacris i'm the last of a dyin breed
and we almost extinct so i'm sayin it loud
say it with me 
say it with me 
say it with me 



i got it baby
and i'm an mc i move the crowd like moses
like the red sea i wear red like roses
go against me and you'll be dead like roses
spittin at your head full of bread like toasters
never had a holster i keep it on my lap
and hip hop ain't dead it just had a heart attack
but you see i keep it pumpin yeah i got that heart back
so just call me little carter or little cardiac
precious like an artifact valuable like a quarterback
hannibal like they call me jack throwback like a starter hat
now how did he thought of that i mean how did he think of that
i mean how did i think of that now like a rental bring it back
i mean how did i think of that i surprise myself sometimes
someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme
every time i do it i do it dirty like swine
for the dirty and fine hip hop i'm alive

 
 i'm a lyricist to the death and i got what you need
 weezy f the last of a dyin breed
 and we almost extinct so i'm sayin it loud
 say it with me

this is music muscle mania my verse is on steroids
private planes i'm on the jet son like elroy
flyin through the sky at amazin speeds
we on that superman kush or that amazin weed
the new bentley came out my team said "luda get it"
20 thou' says that i'm the only nigga wit it
new era on yo' brain like a a town fitted
and i'm not e 40 but i'm so sick wid it
that my flow got the flu hoes i got a few
but i'm stingy with the dough i'm like "no not for you"
what the fuck was you thinkin off what i'm thinkin
me and wayne on that lean what the fuck was you drinkin
stinkin like a dead body off in the woods
so i snatched her like a weave comin off in the hood
and if you down for no bad then we up to no good
and it's important that you make it understood


 luda
i done killed so many niggaz in the booth i sell rappers on ebay 
cause every one of my verses been instant like replays 
speakers get blown like candles on yo' b day 
cause luda's catalog got mo' records than the dj 
the bank yells "mayday" cause every day's a payday
i put it on tape and then i'll sell it like ray j
but not out the sto'  straight to the buyer
cause i slung 'em out my trunk like the dc sniper
and six albums later you'll deposit every word
'til your memory bank gives me the credit i deserve
top 5 damn right but really it just hit me
that three of yo' top 5's too scared to fuck with me 
so how can i advance if you don't give me no opponents 
how can you see the future if you livin for the moment 
hip hop couldn't die i never offer my condolence
but i'll offer y'all a day of atonement   cause

 
i'm a lyricist to the death so i got what you need

 they say o'reilly don't like him 
oprah won't invite him 
the president denounced him  no one will announce him 
controversial lyrics like i'm cryin for help
i'm very talented but i should be ashamed of myself 
but this is my art  this is my music 
i'm speakin from the heart hit record and i'll lose it
bite my tongue for no one i'll put you on blast 
so all the news channels y'all could kiss my ass
and if i dish it i could take it fix it if you break it
could hit rock bottom and i'm still gon' make it 
cause i'm a born hustler natural survivor
seed of a gangsta i put that on my father
youtube or google me turn it up and play it 
cause many people think it i just had the balls to say it 
and risk losin everything i stand for the weak
plus i live for my freedom of speech   cause

now check my pedigree my bloodline is purebred
my champagne is rose cuz the color is more red
my pockets like skin when i whip they swell up 
those 26 inches fill the wheel well up 
you can catch me in the winter with a mink on my shoulders
i like everything big so my diamonds like boulders
and yea i had every kinda roadster or rover
cuz i love the fast lane like a supercharged motor
and i'm so damn hood like gold daytons on a regal
but in '09 i gotta dime on the back of a screamin eagle
big chicken hard make it hard spin it in the pot
and now its millions every year whether albums drop or not

   2x

i pass up in it and be like what it do
all red to my feet but my diamonds clear blue
nuttin like the police in a porsche 911
stuntin up that stairway to heaven
and i'm evidently not you and nuttin like ya
if i as a dog i wouldn't bite ya
nor i'm not beside ya boy i'm way in front of ya
you ain't even see me ya

wonder who the fuck i am
uhh yeah want you to feel it
my voice probably sounds mad raspy right now
i want you all to feel it
so step up on the mic and uhh
show them what you got tiger


sometimes i wonder who the fuck i am
so i've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
i'm askin' what am i supposed to do
i've done so much in my short lifetime but i haven't done shit
i done flew around the whole world
first i shook a million hands and i took a million pictures
but i'm a hostage in my own world
and my thoughts my own enemy got no time for these bitches
i got too much on my damn mind
so if i add some more stress i just don't see how i'ma cope
i think they underestimate the grind
i do bring this doe and i'm only 20 years old
i wonder why i sip this devil juice
cause it feel incredible problems i got several
thank god that none of that medical
ugh i've been blessed with much to be expected


what am i doing here
i wonder what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here


i hope this feelin' lasts for fuckin' ever
i don't want to come back down let me stay above the ground
i hope i do what i was meant to do
cause i've been searching for that answer i just hope i get it now
please let me find euphoria
when you up above the clouds like who gonna touch me now
and do we ever get to know the truth
cause everyone seems to have it but to me it seems they lack it
now i'm rolling and i'm sipping lean
sometimes i catch a buzz just to help me picture love
drinking liquor and i'm smoking weed
and you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
wonder why i scream and stare at you
i'll be there to rescue you problems you got several
thank god that none of that medical
ugh i've been blessed with much to be expected


what am i doing here
i wonder what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here


sittin' in my bentley thinkin' bout these hoes
all i do is kill them i kill them like nicole
simpson flag crimson smoke them like winstons
i just bought a new chopper i treat it like an infant
i'm lightin' up a stogie it's longer than a hoagie
situation's gettin' fishy and i don't eat anchovies
fuck the world kill them all she answer when i call
if the cops pull us over she gon' hide it in her drawers
see i come from a place where stars never shine
and drama is accepted credit cards are declined
everybody gotta die but i ain't everybody
if that ho play with me i whoop that chick like terrence howard
i'm a pimp i ain't lyin' but that is not important
i'm just tryna to buy time but can't really afford it
saying ain't that a bitch but i hope that bitch is bad
i feel like money in the trash like


what am i doing here
i wonder what am i doing here
what am i doing here
what am i doing here

first verse :

betrayal for the decline in drug sales
war over turf here will cause more drama than waco
that's why i lay low and try to improvise on all your weak spots
see what the street got
for me maybe two cheap glocks
for free benjamin franklin currency
is used to pay bills and insurance to bury me
i'm magna to carta player haters don't bother me
y'all oughtta be rollin' shipments instead of quarter ki's
it was told to me
ca$h money connect from overseas
two tons of white ones and maybe
but then they might come so i'ma
take preparation
pick out a proper stash location
fill it with choppers and watch them
narcotic cases undercovers investigatin'
yo russ where the man with the dope  i'm startin' to get impatient
two days blew by our package arrived
followed by a call from the boss for me to do a homicide

second verse :



chillin' in my hood while you know it's all good
camoflauged down to the socks with some soldier reeboks
i got's to play it like that cuz i'm a soldier for real

hey chyeah blow the horns on 'em
the sun is out it's a brand new day and it just dawned on 'em
the smoke in here got 'em floating just like in salt water
and break is fast we gotta cook it just like a short order
dont feed dem hens when the birds covered in cheetah print
a jungle out there and the jail is the zoo that keep us in
players in gators is crazy we feel the need to rock 'em
furs coming in all different colors like peta got 'em
killing yourself for a salary; look ya line flatter 
than stomachs of the women that's running watching them calories
hope that we linking we smoking and drinking casually
cause life without living ain't nothing but a fallacy




say who's that peekin' in my window
is that sunshine is that one time
let that sun shine through my living room
hospitality is what i'm giving you
harsh reality is what i've been through
but i'm not alone ask her and him too
and they shall tell ya ain't nothin' better
than the smell of a new day 
i know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark
and ya don't see what he's trying to show ya
and i know the wall may seem tall
but if we help each other i guarantee we get over
and once i'm over i'll reach back for my brother
and pull him over as well
keep our heads high and our noses wide open
hopin' for that new day smell   love live life




yeah yeah yeah yeah
yea homie i been waiting since i was 16
to tell 'em what i'm 'bout to tell 'em so i need more than a 16
see i'm the only son of mary and joe
so i gotta fulfill my purpose 'fore i'm buried ya know
my momma say she having visions of me being a missionary
and the hood looking at me as a walking visionary
so i sit back and wonder will i ever have my time to shine
and die like pac in his prime
or will i go out like len bias and od before the tryouts
no tell the reaper no buyout
i'm good i pray for a head to protect ya
and i gotta walk the streets with the heat as my protection
still gotta watch my back still watch my front home
cause i seen a lot of niggas die with they gun on
so with that in mind i just get higher
and pray to the higher messiah i'm no liar
and they say that puffing the fire fucks with your memory
but i got a lot of stuff that i don't wan' remember see
like when my homie ivin died
i like how i never seen a man cry 'til i seen lance died
never seen my pops cry 'til i seen my grams died
and i'm here to tell him that i miss my grams too
and i wish i could hug her for mothers day too
and i feel the same way that you do
but we gotta still move on so she can just smile down on us
and i don't want the lord to ever frown down on us
i know that they really got power in a gun
but i also know that they got power in a tongue
so every time i speak look i try to speak life
y'all tweaking for broads i tweak life
they said i was s'posed to die as a fetus
my momma said i bind that devil in the name of jesus
so now i'm here just to talk to y'all
come and stroll with me homie let me walk wit' y'all
ten million ways to die so i chose
to get my life right by the end of the road
'fore my body in a casket and i'm stiff and froze
'fore i'm laying in a morgue with a tag on my toes
i'm here to tell you take heed to the warnings
school shootings hurricanes and global warming
open ya bibles up with no hesitation
bc was the genesis this is revelations
so you better pick your destination
tomorrow ain't promised better pick your destination
rest in peace b spencer rest in peace pimp c
shit could be worse so i'm feeling like weezy
i wake up in the morning take a piss and wash my hands
take a knee and thank the man and leave my life in god's hands yea

who on the outside had everything people wished they had
a beautiful daughter two story house two car garage
and a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard

and i guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
of you and your posse partying drinking what you get handed
wit your virgin island tans all looking like you just landed

cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave
this generation is destined to do historic deeds

slanndering your name behind that screen name
they're lame and their life is pretty plain
m&m's with no nuts

like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
address it on a case by case basis like the judge
what about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot
or these niggaz on the block who want the queen 
but even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
but god don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting




i do love you but you hate me at the same time

to love her and cherish her for all your life
i solemnly swear to dare share take you there

cause my heart is out of service my eyes turn black
i don't see love anymore i'm blind to the fact

the sky is at my neck so i turn up my collar
my world spin around her cause it's a whirl without her

then the sunlight falls down  there she goes
strobe lights dance with the stars
and i just can't live without her 
and she know what she knows 
and the rain is comin down

strobe lights dance with the stars
and i always take my time

geographically earthed in a place called queens
i was formed with my principles way i displayed
when i used to cool out where all the other kids played 
'cause i was way too ill i would hone my skill
go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
right there on farmers boulevard i made my mark
two dudes brothers would dip from us me and narcs
and then my legend would grow on the a train line
where rappers would gather to see my blowin nicks and dimes
it was me big pete tanya and sa 
when in the heat of the cipher i was not libel
for all the casualties of the dutty mcs'
i split the train car like moses did the red sea
get it in ya head we gon' rock the dead
night of the living mcs' the weak ones fled

while i hunt and eat you niggaz like food leavin you bleedin

it's a slight chance that your ass just might make it 
to hear the record come out

your world is ghetto


i could never win an oscar 'cause i don't know how to act

and just when i thought i was gonna do just that
poppa was a rolling stone and them stone was crack
fuck being like mike i wanna be like pop

please put down the pipe you don't need that rock
please put up a fight for the kids that watch
us in the spotlight and then they mock
but caskets get closed and then they drop
and cases get closed and they are dropped
'cause no one knows and nobody got
any out nor n o 'cause they better not
three words to a witness they get shot
let me tell you what this is this is the block
always talk to god never listen to cops

 john legend


it's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
there's only one nas by the hundred thousand you's

niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry
morgues full of dead niggas who was taking money
morgues full of niggas who the last shit they ate in stomach

she know we fly she pick a flight in no time
i'll be by my own business why you busy minding mine

and later were separated we hate it i'm glad you made it
when your mountain top they say there's no where to go but down
but i'll be chillin' just look around
perpendicular momma be straight forever

and what i'm representing here is putting holes in brains
before i say the same thing i'll be old and grey
'fore i fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
gripping grain and popping trunks dog but that ain't me
these elbows hit the scene back in eighty three
i stay street when it's done that's that
you could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
i roll over rodents in rovers with rims on 'em
sniffing out a rat i expose him and then dome him

lookin from the surface it may seem like i got reason to be nervous
then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
verses autobiographical absolutely classical
last thing i'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do

even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstandin quality
sell a lot of records i'll respect it and salute that
but spittin real life on hot beats i'm the truth at

and keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
unless somebody who want him in his body
to love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
from the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
do you understand to live to lie by him
is to share your soul lord knows you gone die by him
i know you heard gun stories about john wayne and billy the kid
shit all them motherfuckers dead
and did you know that every other bitch from the wild wild west

they got they mind on they money money on they mind
they got they finger on the trigger hand on the nines
see everyday they feel the struggle but staying on they grind
and ain't nobody takin' from us and that's the bottom line
but i know there's a drop in the block
you move slow

you don't know not to lay low
because 25 to life is no joke

all the beautiful women getting' money
washin' them dollar bills like laundry




money money money money

 she used to be 
she used to be the sweetest girl ever
now she like sour ameretta
she wears a dress to the t like the letter
and if you make it rain she will be under the weather
she used to run track back in high school
now she tricks off the track right by school
she takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose
so respect her i'll pay up for the time used
and then she runs to the pastor
and he tells her there will be a new chapter
but she feels no different after
and then she asks him
