black cotton
black cotton
black cotton   a symbol for unrewarded struggle
time for a little gospel tail
ghetto gospel that is  listen
robbin' black cotton in god's eyes
speak


black cotton
steady stressin' smith and wessons count my blessin's
class is in session the worst question is the first question
why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
never got paid but still we slave 
answer that then answer this too 
loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
you best to backtrack and try to act black and live
not to be phony and positive but why be negative
what's the matter g black cat got your tongue
fat track gotcha sprung now your hung 
dum dum diddy is it me
attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
if not peace then at least let's get a piece
i'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets  deceased
lookin' through my highschool yearbook
reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
one homie two homie three homies   poof
we used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
god come save the misbegotten
lost ghetto souls of black cotton 


nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care


in the belly of the beast i'm bubbling up
running out of luck about to self destruct
old heads say live your life like such
your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
i wouldn't listen to 'em
your power movement was cool
but it ain't fix nothin'
so i just go with what i know
i don't trust none
look what the 80's did
to what's bebe's kids
and now we grown up
nobody ain't own us yet


black cotton i'm plottin'   
i'm workin' without a profit
they shacklin' all my homies
i'm hurtin' but keep the mind

certainly we survive with outlaw ridas
what's the reward for a strugala
if the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
runnin up gun cocked like nasty gloves
if you ain't got a penny mind the glove
no love
waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
black cotton   i'm hoppin' over enemy lines
black cotton   i ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
black cotton



nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care

nobody don't care
so what i'm gonna do hopefully is i wanna be
i i don't wanna be i am tupac shakur




everywhere i see a soldier a soldier
everywhere i see a soldier like me


posse deep as i roll through the streets
motherfuck the police as we creep in our jeeps
layin so low you'd think i'm asleep
but at the slightest beef i'm robbin niggaz of they teeth
and opd can get the dick if they play toughy
last time them niggaz rushed me i ain't bust but now i'm touched
trust me ain't nuttin jumpin but these buckshots
a nigga's got enough knocks i'm poppin at corrupt cops 
them motherfuckers catch a hot one
you wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one
and there's no prison that can hold ya
motherfuck a soldier ready to roll or take control
so now i jack 'em while they sleepin
roll to the door throw a grenade in the precinct 
some people panic brothers bugged out
i had to keep poppin cause there's no stoppin 'til they rubbed out
and they vest don't protect from the head wounds
reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon 
smoke risin from the barrel of my shotty
i finally got revenge now count the bodies
twenty cops one for every year in jail
tryin to keep a nigga down but you failed
before i let you take me i told ya
fuck bein trapped i'm a soldier


i betcha that's how i got some things you ain't got
that's called courage and it don't come
from no flick or bottle it ain't scotch
it's not bourbon i don't walk around
like no g cause that ain't me
i'm not that person i don't try
to act like you do cause that ain't you
you just burpin you ain't


2pac in the mad bitch
in the six fo' rag on them thangs that's a bad bitch
gettin ghost on them bitches in the town
bustin out the back seat nigga when we clown
homey is you down  d got the strap and she anxious 
hurry up 'fore she spank shit 
comin 'round the corner spittin rounds they can't hold me down
caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounds
now tell me how that sound a double date laced with hate
make 'em pray for the judgment day
now tell me how that sound a double date laced with hate
make 'em pray for the judgment day   stinkin beotch



 2pac


everywhere i see a soldier a soldier
everywhere i see a soldier like me
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken fine so many babies screamin'
cuz they seein destruction before they see a human bein
so they start smoking we will never get our day
until we learn to pray keep our families in shake
cuz they all broken why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly somebody else should try 
cocking guns smoking we can all make a change
so i'm told but i haven't seen a change unfold
i'll keep hopin please if you prefer to breathe
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open i can only say i'll try
until the day i die i promise to be wise
with my heart open greed brings only misery
away the tragedy so i stay sucker free
only a few chosen rise my ghetto queens rise
don't be afraid to try too many of us die
before they daughter open wise my brother's speak wise
stay focused on the prize though everybody dies


we can only learn to take our anger and our hate
control our mental stakes settle down and set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
before we said it regret it later and let it escalate 
cuz by then its just too late there's so much we can take
and there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
to the point that he just brakes snaps and its all it takes
you think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
but we ain't its plain to go against 
with every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints
but in the mist of all this anger and this angst 
never once did you heard me say i'm a gangster and i aint hear any complaints
but i know that i will always continue to grow
as long as i lead and never follow no one else's shadow
there will never be another me and that i can guarantee 
that's why the fuck i remain sucker free
to this day the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame and success they attain
there will never be another me 
and no matter what they do there will never be another you
you can search but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die we are forever alive

 and we continue growin one day at a time


don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money ya like
seachin for fortune and fame and superstardom
all the jury all the calls who grouse is harder
there's not a hip hop police the villains is watchin
and the kids think beef is they only option
outlawz born filthy guilty as charged
my memories took a die my macaveli lives on
you think the industry is fun and no pity with guns
and when your money is up that's when your enemies come
so if he die and came back would he try to save rap
we needing a change the drama remains  the same

i spend my whole life  fightin myself
that i cant win so i'm invitin some help
and hey now then i take rights and no lefts
i'm still just like a kid lookin for stripes on my belt
yeah that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god take a light to myself
no matter how much i try stay alive i'm a die a man
still standin there in love my pride

my heart  we passed that
i'm tryin to keep  keep comin and collect all my ass cap
the rappers in the game ain't change
and i finally realize that we not in the same game
the hatin' will never end so i guess i'll deal with it
them 45's will pop killa's yes i'm still with it
the streets is military you gotta be a soldier
gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
they do what they gotta do to shock them and hold us
so we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin
one way at a time keep the faith in your mind

 and we continue growin one day at a time

as the echo follows the maserati as it petrol swallows
i'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check yo' bible inside it it'll say this guy's an elephant
i'm fly like i'm killin the scene like i'm a villain with wings
i'll sleep when i'm six feet deep right now i'm livin a dream 
though we may be reckless the ladies check us
they whisper   shady records; baby echo~


uhh first verse uh i'm armed 'til i'm on an island
my life's ridin on the autobahn on auto pilot
before i touch dirt
or kill y'all with kindness i kill ya my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you been borned or if you conformed
slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
leave him with his socks hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggaz intellect mad slow y'all fags know
claimin you bangin you flamin

my blood type's the '80s my '90s was like the navy
you was like the brady's you still fly kites daily

inside a dang insane asylum; came to drive them
trailer parks crazy i am back and i am razor sharp baby
and that's back with a capital b with an exclamation mark maybe

cause after i spit the bullets i'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
i'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick i'ma live this


i'm livin life in the fast lane
movin at the speed of life and i can't slow down

just gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm livin life in the fast lane 
livin life in the fast lane 


uhh yeah
my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle as captain morgan attacks my organs 
my slow flow is euphoric it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says "i'll let you take me
you let me take a shovel dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian"
go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm livin the life of the infinite enemy down my tenement chimney now
the semi's the remedy pow spin him around enterin in the vicinity

he shuts the whole motherfuckin walmart d d down every time he comes a r r round
and he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
like a motherfuckin chick underwater he's tryin to dr dr drown
shorty when you dance you got me captivated 
just by the way that you keep lickin them dick suckin lips i'm agitated
aggravated to the point you don't suck my dick then you're gonna get decapitated
other words you don't fuckin give me head then i'ma have to take it


and then after takin that i'ma catch a case it's gon' be fascinatin
it's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson's activator 
meanin i'm on fire off the top might wanna back up the data
rollin over hip hop in a verbal tractor trailer
homie they sick you could normally ask a hater

nickel nina nigga twitter beefin first rapper that shot a fan
this one's for you and me livin out our dreams
where are right where we should be
with my arms out wide i open my eyes
and now all i wanna see
is a sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs
a sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs


by the time you hear this i will have already spiralled up
i would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
if i was you i would duck   or get struck like lightnin
fighters keep fightin put your lighters up point 'em skyward uhh
had a dream i was king i woke up still king
this rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'til nobody else even fuckin feels me 'til it kills me
i swear to god i'll be the fuckin illest in this music
there is or there ever will be; disagree feel free
but from now on i'm refusing 
to ever give up only thing i ever gave up's using
no more excuses excuse me if my head is too big for this building
and pardon me if i'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
poppin shit on how you flipped your life around crock of shit
who you dicks tryin to kid flip "dick" you did opposite
you stayed the same cause "cock" backwards is still "cock" you pricks
i love it when i tell 'em shove it
cause it wasn't that long ago when marshall sat flustered lacked luster
cause he couldn't cut mustard
muster up nothin brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin woke up from that buzzer
now you wonder why he does it how he does it wasn't cause he had buzzards
circlin around his head waitin for him to drop dead was it
or was it cause them bitches wrote him off little hussy ass scuzzes
fuck it guess it doesn't matter now does it
what difference it make what's it take 
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
from a place that was dark as i was in just to get to this place
now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage
and let it be known that from this day forward i wanna just say thanks
cause your hate is what gave me this strength
so let them bic's raise
cause i came with 5'9" but i feel like i'm 6'8"




by the time you hear this i'd probably already be outtie
i advance like goin from totin iron
to goin and buyin four or five of the homies the iron man audi
my daddy told me "slow down boy you goin to blow it"
and i ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell shady i love him 
the same way that he did dr dre on "the chronic"
tell him how real he is or how high i am
or how i would kill for him for him to know it
i cried plenty tears   my daddy got a bad back
so it's only right that i write 'til he can march 
right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
now his career is lebron's jersey in 20 years
i stop when i'm at the very top
you shitted on me on your way up it's 'bout to be a scary drop
cause what goes up must come down
you goin down on somethin you don't wanna see like a hairy box
every hour happy hour now life is wacky now
used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy now i'm just the cat's meow
oww out class the count
always down for the catch weight like pacquiao
y'all are doomed   y'all remember when t pain ain't wanna work with me
my car starts itself parks itself and auto tunes
cause now i'm in the aston
i went from havin my city locked up to gettin treated like kwame kilpatrick
and now i'm fantastic compare it to a weed high
and y'all niggaz that's gossipin like bitches
on the radio and tv see me we fly
y'all buggin out like wendy williams starin at a beehive
and how real is that
i remember signin my first deal now i'm the second best i can deal with that
now bruno can show his ass
without the mtv awards gag 


you and i know what it's like
to be kicked down forced to fight
but tonight we're alright
so hold up your lights let it shiiiiine
cause


don't stop 


yeah bad and evil is 

uhh we 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin
'01's the year where i fell from blunderin
shady lifted his wing then i fell from under it
now i'm free fallin my career has gone into recallin
regardless of who's fault i was speed ballin
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
then marshall double backed and got me from on top of a hearse
i'm alive nigga
justin t ain't got nothin on me cause i done cried mary j blige rivers
i realized that god's with us
soon as i decided to put that bottle down and pick up my todd bridges
the writin's on the wall   since niggaz seen me 
at the baseball game with shady and jay z suddenly everybody calls
like "i'm just checkin on you dawg"
while i throw up this message on the stall


when them bottles stop poppin and them dollars start stoppin
do what you did to get it and don't stop 
i made a promise to my momma i'ma out live her
how can i be a quitter when haters don't stop 
i'm livin proof nigga it's pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away 
it's the worldwide american way
i'm livin proof nigga 


your body language is sayin your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil' homie come on
you just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it
tell 'em where to shove it
straight up you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it
the last time that life kicked me in the ass
i pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
and not open a can of whoop ass let you pissants whoop me
would be the day i say i ate poop
shit the day that i don't straight shoot i'll drop out of my anti woman hate group
say i'm a sissy faggot record it play it back and put it on straight loop
you haters look like you ate a grapefruit
you see me climbin back on that wagon got my swagger back i was draggin
hopped back on it grabbed the reigns on that bastard
and came back on 'em without remorse man of course
i'm a one trick pony cause i'll be screamin on these whores 'til i'm hoarse/horse




nah i ain't fadin yet
i'd rather stay and rap i mighta made a debt
but i find excitement in wonderin what i'ma write next
so i don't stay in debt

with the baby with ak's with baby bayonets
i'ma get rich or i'ma die tryin
that's why it's either kill or be killed so call me suicide homicide ryan


there's a bomb inside my head i'm a live wire
i am on the edge teeterin on it like a totter i might 
get on a nut like a tire iron; i have no desire stoppin

and i'm laughin at 'em the entire time why am i up
cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch i'm fired up
so one time for me just let your fuckin lighters light the sky up~

life handed me lemons i jumped back in the public eye
and squirted lemon juice in it by now you just wish i'd fuckin die
but i electrify get electrocuted executed by
the execution of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin by
 gue gue guess who what's happenin guy

of rapper would i be 'fore i let another rapper think he's hot

battery in royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine

"relapse" sucked i snapped hit the gas like 
blew through the light spun out hit a patch of black ice
forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back we jackknifed
bitch flew out the car i laughed like she deserved it
she didn't think i'd act like that in person

  

tell him i'll be there in a minute
i'm tryin to break up this catfight between my mistress and damn wife
then a chick wanted a hug she was fat
so i gave her dap then i tell her to scat
i'm not mean i'm cute; on my way to the front door takin the scenic route
to avoid this chick with a lace front lookin like venus's and serena's hooves
i'm just sayin them chicks got horse asses they been attractive
hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets
my mind drifted back to this shit
i see my wife push her down step over her body then smack the mistress
police outside i turn and pass the gat to vishis
then i step out and see my evil twin; he gives me an evil grin
he mugs the mistress turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses
looks at me twisted like nickel 
he smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rolled with
and looks back to mention 
they said

is everything not enough
what more can i give up
is there anyone that i can trust
i give you my all and you still take from me


uh always been the type of dude that'd feed my clique
i know that without the fans i ain't shit but y'all better read my lips
i don't spit raps this ill for you to just hack and steal and leak my shit so peep my drift
i hope y'all don't think y'all helpin me out with that shit that shit's stressin me out
nickel nine is blowin up   christmas time you should hang my album 
on top of your fireplace cause around that time my stockin is goin up
feels like a victory bittersweet cause the bigger i get the bigger the wedge
between the relationship of me and my bigger bro hear what i said
feels like the shit was wished on me   everything i do for the nigga and the nigga know 
i would do anything for him but the nigga refuse to quit just straight shittin on me
keepin yo' distance probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me
but you know me probably best fuck pity
you want that you know it's laila ali chest tough titty
the problem is you got a problem you think that i'm already set
so i'ma look down on you just be proud of me you already got my respect
i ain't tryin to say somethin i'd regret so i'ma just stop chasin the pain
let you deal with the fact that we don't get along cause i got a big face in the game
sometimes i feel like fuck my life   i fuck with a few niggaz 
that i know if my chick was a shady hoe niggaz wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
guess that's the difference in friends and associates
i done been broke i done been through the motions
i don't pay no attention to birds i use my scope and i tend to the vultures
no one ever blows up your phone just to talk i don't make money just to loan it to y'all
tell a nigga that think you whylin is like dialin and then talkin to a hole in the wall
please look at these expenses these niggaz expensive
if i gotta lend you money every time i see you just to be ya friend bitch
i don't really need your friendship


is everything not enough
what more can i give up
is there anyone that i can trust
i give you my all and you still take from me
i give and i give and you take and you take
and you just walk away without noth ing to say
you just take from me ay ay ayy
you just take from me ay ay ayy
ay ay ayy 


i live in a bubble i struggle with the fame
trouble is the pain grows double give a fuck what you say
when my music you take so subtle just to give it away
to people who don't even appreciate flows motherfucker i'm livid today
cause i break my back to give you my art
you steal my thoughts it's like drivin a spike through my heart
you might not think it's that big of a deal to steal from me but music's all i got
aside from my daughters not to sound like a martyr but it's gettin harder than i thought
to not just go crazy trapped in this house i'm about to just snap am i not
deservin of what i got did i not work for it put it all on every record i record
well then please tell me why on this earth lord 
does it keep happenin i keep rappin but i wonder sometimes is it worth all
the bullshit cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin up from
but i won't let it get me down i won't succumb i'm anything but glum so fuck 'em~
they'll appreciate me when i'm gone they'll say i was ill right the way i killed mics
but the way i feel right now it just feels like 
i'm so done with this shit that i may as well wipe
i have nothin else to give you nothin else to contribute farewell i bid you
but before i go my last gift to you ladies and gentlemen slaughterhouse i give you


yeah 
told you we'd be back 
welcome to hell 


there's a switch i flip emotions cut off
so cold i done froze my butt off
and this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
it's like squirtin a squirt gun in the ocean fuck off
other words i ain't put a dent in the game 
compared to the damage i have yet to do
as long as you still have feelings to hurt
i'll be around as long as you let me get to you
long as i got two balls to palm
i'll be the bomb you just a false alarm
get scant little pissants 
and see if i don't come along and stomp your farm
thunder and lightning rain hail sleet 
with a tornado's the kind of brain storm i get
so when wind starts blowin shit
talk about goin in goin insane's more like it
wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it 
like a disastrous blizzard
so you better listen quick fast or miss it
yeah go ahead little prick bastard diss it
but when you get hit with a sick ass explicit 
flow don't ask how much of his passion is it
that goes in it just know that all he knows is that 
it's better to kick ass than kiss it
dick dastardly of audacity
mental capacity unmatched it has to be
stopped but it can't be but man i can't just keep 
doin 'em like that or no one'll rap with me 
except one you ask who is it


guess who just came through the blast you bitches
with the ratchet the book of mathew
a book of matches lightin 'em under white linen
you 'bout to have to admit it
they pass you the mic ask you to spit it
and you got handed your own ass your ass in your own hands
i'm sure they gon' laugh when you goin to the bathroom wit it
now with what would you come against us better be
somethin with a bigfoot pedigree
easily these are the reasons 
that we need to be in y'all prayers
each region breeds them mc's that wanna be them 
what means that they wanna breathe our air
with these ideas
anybody thinkin the game don't need the bad and the evil regime
that's like sayin that the bad boy piston team didn't need isaiah


shit piss and bleed this is a different breed of mc's i swear
better beware there's too much at stake/steak 
and to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
you can kiss my ass and eat shit stains 
out my underwear that i don't even wear


it's gotta be no fair
it's like hittin the lottery oh yeah
who you know hotter there gotta be no pair
shotty that i got'll lobotomy yo' hair
classic smash it smother it
read it and weep then perhaps you will have no rebuttal in
fact you seein me in this rappin 
is like sayin tila tequila can sing like jazmine sullivan


back to bash your skull again
push a bitch out the aspen and tell her 
"get the fuck outta dodge" 
shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
you has beens are duller than color books that ain't colored in
second and third fourth wind got another wind
here they come again none other than 
bad and evil also known as saddam and osama bin
it's been a long time 
but i bet that neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
and we only get iller with time
me and nickel fuckin shit up on a dime so tellin us to pipe down's
like talkin to a meth head
bruce willis on his death bed last breath with an infection
fightin it while he's watchin internet porn 
'bout to meet his death with an erection
my god what i mean is 
david carradine jackin his penis in front of his tripod
chokin his own neck what part you don't get
i'm sayin i die hard


when you listenin to my bars
nothin but the f i r e comin out your ipod
we come up in the place 
chicks heads start spinnin like motherfuckin white walls


got your mother suckin my balls 
while we fuck each other we punch each other in the eyeballs
and i never say i'm sor ry
the 5'9" and the fire marshall 
we spit with an intensity to shut shit down in the industry
two different entities with a propensity 
to put these n u t's up inside of your fuckin mouth


haha aw shit stop it 
yo welcome to the cd 
from the moment i go to bed 'til i wake up all day
this is all i can think about baby 
so i'll go straight at opponents' heads with this anger always
cause this is all i can think about baby 


the chopper got about fifty bullets
ain't no way it's accidental when i spill 'em on you
i'm the realist in the biz
how you livin 
cause you can get it how you live
and while you livin i'ma say my pull out game is so real
i'll still get rid of kids
now that's ill
the top of your head can fly off the top of convertibles
ain't gon' really take no time to come through and murder you
i don't fake mine
i do this the fair way
snitches get stitches
blown away and left on display
hung by the grapevine
i just kicked the chair away
let me be the first to tell you that you're lookin at a superstar
my microphone and ak 47 that's my new guitar
i don't belong to you and i don't care who you are
yeah you sold a couple records got a couple joints
got a few jordans three four pairs of louboutins 
that's besides the point like a shootin guard 
nigga i'm a rock star

  
with whoopin cough
 sick george clooney with a uzi what kind of a movie star
would hop out a moving car just to prove he's hard
"fuck you doin you retard"
should be put in a cast as soon as we start shooting dawg
you swear i knew where the roofies are
the way i drug a bitch through the yard
stuffed little suzie in cardboard after wrappin her nude and newly scarred
body in water proof tarp covered in roofing tar
so what you so blunt for did
you fuckin fall off chump or did you jump or did you just become more with
cause you're slippin into a funk i just become morbid
and more self absorbed in my own world everyone orbits
pen at the table i don't know when i'll be able to stop told you from the gate
one thought it generally takes and i'm off to the races wait
mentally stable hold your fuckin horses
there's nothin more disgusting an animal i just got done snortin
the fuckin bathroom soap and the tannin lotion to unwarp this
mind you gon' need some sort of
an antidote there's not a pill for bananas though it's unfortunate
you got delusions of grandeur though
actin like you're michelangelo with a fuckin cordless
bitch i'm shredder so you better crawl back in your shell or run 'fore ya
get injured a fuckin ninja turtle wouldn't come tortoise/toward us
two joint forces of course this is what blunt force is
cause we'd/weed smoke you on any joint
bad and evil's back bitch you might experience some shortness
of breath as you sit with your lungs punctured here them motherfuckin tears come pourin
if i tell you once more then you're done for
you're gonna have to learn how to fuckin hear from a ruptured eardrum forest
am i clear you gump you're as
dumb as a stump to think we'd come with a trump shortage
b b b b bass in your face bitch chuck norris's
nunchucks morph into guns swords
this is what blood sport is
the goriest glorious notorious big amous shogun warriors


goddamn the slaughter boy general
once i slaughter it you couldn't un slaughter it
once i order a hit you couldn't un order it
hit's an order this the consortium




if i don't got no more drama bitch i'm a fish outta water
bottle after all of these guys i slaughter
applause is getting louder how the fuck did this happen
i never rapped for bitches how's it my audience now is broader
devil without a cause rebel without a pause
i'm a "kaze" without the "kami"/comma
you wouldn't be a g if it cost me a thousand dollars
infrared in my pencil lead but always keep an extra one stocked though
in the back pocket and both of 'em locked and they're loaded
like cocked twin glocks that i'm holdin
you better pause when you see these two dots on your colon
fuckin punks you wait just got to rockin and rollin
cause elvis ain't left the building yet i'm still a villain
you feel a threat when i step in and kill a set in a millisec'
with the weapon of intellect hannibal lecter with the black belt and kung fu
protect your neck and

  
respect the gun rule
read in the art of war book 'bout sun tzu
you realize if you defy
you probably won't be around here/hair long rapunzel

bitch i got the bands in my pocket and the drumroll poppin
that's ehhh that's overkill
i keep the kill under me i keep the chill one degree
i'll hit you with a hook that'll make you see threes
you realize as soon as you beat me
that you didn't yeah it's still one of me
i'll meat slap you that's a recap view that's normal embarrassing
and you slap me that's knee slap humor that's hardly hilarious
so we scrap over you lying/lion like a feline cub in a forest cherishin
a kill from a dominant male


and i'm born with malaria
a form of lou gehrigs to the torture and terrify corporate america
poor little erica in the morning the sheriff's
and law enforcement'll find one fourth of her buried under a barrier
of the kitchen floor with the stairs in an outdoor wooded area~




back then hoes didn't want him
now the black benz all hid in corners
my spectacular vernacular

let me translate i'm tryna find me a bitch
and then i'm suckin on her neck while she naked
and then i'm shittin on her


and i'm gettin boners from what i'm spittin
gettin blown to smithereens in a toyota
gettin stoner jonas brothers
brothers songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flippin
 a time bomb with a nervous tickin
'nother murder victim i flirted with them first and burrr stick 'em
i burn up if i try to step on inside a church chicken
 wanna  wanna
makin sure any who battle me crawl away
assault and battery holiday and just when you're thinkin that'll be all i say
i'll start automatically callin names
and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy
but i'll disappear quick as natalee holloway
it's my mentality all the way
i'm normally a suicide mission to try dissin
but one thing that i never mind's gettin
called elvis all the time in the articles that you write which is why i never reply
cause he died shittin so ah shittin i'm spittin
my infinite supply of written
bona fide kiddin aside critics stick my little white dick in
your eyelid and fuck it switch subjects
movin on to the next one it's ch chucky
who wanna play with number one overall kid cudi
a psycho buddy who might go nutty cause he don't like nobody
his knife's so bloody cause he just sliced somebody
pull out the schick hydro and


in light of what he
just said this for those who even kinda want it
cause for this man i would take a lighter and light up all of my "lighter" money
you can call it pyro money hi rihanna
i mean wait hi tianna; wait hi tatiana
shit i gotta problem and i don't like it
it's called "fuck a model" itis

sit yo' ass down i don't like the pussy too tight
get the fuck outta here and have some babies
vocabulary still ill

i'm so far ahead of the skills here
gettin ready for my past life i'm the real deal

  
like holyfield
think you irreplaceable/ear replaceable bite it 
'til i keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill
and ebola in my bowl of oatmeal you know the deal
i'm not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
of how i'm how i'm cold steel like an old cold snowmobile
and no feelin but so jovial
but don't be one of those who mistake me for a joke i'm so for real
it's what i told the phony mc before i broke his will
drove a drill through his skull to see his soul told him when i snap like a photo he'll
get exposed like a roll of film
now here he goes again
oh i'm so trill i'ma get the hose again

the one man on the planet that'll drive off of the grand canyon
hop out of a grand am and land in it handstandin
any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
i'm headed for hell i'd rather be dead or in jail
bill clinton hit this  and you better inhale
cause any mc that chooses to go against me
is gettin takin advantage of like monica lewinksy 
came home in a frenzy pushin a ten speed
screamin to aunt peg 
with three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
fuck a headache give me a migraine 
damnit i like pain 
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
you rap knowin you wack
you act up and i'm throwin you down a flight of steps
then i'm throwin you back up em
if they don't like the track fuck em
the rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a mack truck
and then backed up on
and any half assed known rapper to trespass
better be ready for the second celebrity deathmatch 
so tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly 
i'm sicker than a tupac dedication to biggie
i'm free fallin feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
and when i'm down to my last breath
i'ma climb the empire state building and get to the last step
and still have half left

chorus

	bad the bad
	uhh when the bad meets the bad yo
	the evil
	take the evil with the evil

	what  nine nine
	two times slim shady royce the five nine

yea yea yea dr dre up in here y'all know what this is
its what y'all been waiting for funk master flex big kap
def jam records giving it to you baby
yo eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby


i used to be a lonely man only mad until i got a million dollars shit
now if i only had some fucking hair i'd pull it faster than a bullet
out of tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
i'm trying to grow it back again it was an accident
i had my back against the fan and chopped it off in amsterdam
i hate the straight jacket it aint latching and can't lock it
so they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
the cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
before me and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
my head is aching i'm dedicated to medication
but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation 
anyway i got down with dre  
the first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
running up and down the street screaming "fuck the police"
when you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth
 became a role model after colorado
now all they do is follow me around and holla bravo
hell yea i punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
suck my dick bitch
i'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but i won't
cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
so put a sock in it with your fake ass tupac image
you faggots ain't tough you just get drunk and become talkative
  i'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
so when you see me on your block stumbling mumbling
a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
i ain't buzzed i'mm juss high on life
so why on earth would i need drugs when i can fly on kites
motherfuckers slim shady

dr dre: dr dre
eminem: i'm drunk pass the tec

chorus: eminem and dr dre 

cause if i get locked up tonite
then i might not come home tonite
	keep it moving off and on eminem is on
	off and on dr dre is on


the whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
i set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron 
psych i'm just joking for christ sake
dont get so bent out of shape 
cause i went out and raped six girlfriends
some people just don't get it but i won't let it upset me
cause they don't know better
they don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
my mind's got a mind of it's own sometimes i can't find it at home
it hides in the stove 
shit talk about your brain being baked
my shit's still in the oven on 480 de grades
hailey jade daddy loves you baby
don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
you critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize
individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
the neighborhood that i grew up in you could die for nothing
and dirty dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
i'll have a fucking man raped with a band aid over his mouth
and shove his head in the fan blade
don't ever tell me what i can and what i can't say
or change cause of the age range in my fan base
like i give a fuck who's buying this shit
quit fucking buying it i'm tired bitch i'm dying to quit
hip hop is universal now it's all commercial now
it's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
but now the white kids like it so they tell me i can buy it
but as soon as i get on the mic it's like the night get silent
either that or booed thats why i keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
i'm sick of being judged fuck it let me see a judge
i'll confess to every murder i committed since 3 years old

chorus


fuck that turn that shit off
let's get the fuck out of here
you know how we do 
make it make it make it boy we gotta make it
you can save your hand i ain't gotta shake it
everything lined up for the takin
and what i need from 'em no favors
clique too big bread gotta break it
cause these others low key with the snakin fakin
everything lined up for the takin
and what i need from 'em no favors
no favors


what i need no favors
e'rything lined up for the takin
and what i need from 'em no favors


i'm about gettin the job done boy up every night
i'm about rollin a seven when i toss up the dice
i'm about gettin my logo all flooded with ice
i'm about takin a risk that might fuck up your life
tell them point and shoot like camera crews in front of cameras too 
"damn sean what happened to the humble attitude"
i'm like niggaz took the flow but i'm still standin too
thought i had the midas touch and then i went platinum too
motherfuck all your comparisons 
i've been talkin to god like that's my therapist
i'm african american in america i ain't inherit shit
but a millionaire under 30 so he must be hearin shit
don don don life i do this for the crib the d to flint
kids who get sick with lead; others get hit with the lead
from where they need a hand out but they tell you put hands up
only deals i had was from the sam's club
now it's blue blood in my veins though you know what i came fo'
born in a world goin where they told me i cain't go
in my lane though i'm in the same boat as usain bolt
get ahead by any means so the head's what i aim fo'
when my grandma died i realized i got an angel
show me everything's a blessing dependin on the angles
look i am the anomaly
never needed favors or apologies that's my new lifetime policy
woodgrain steering wheel this bitch feel like a pirate ship
how many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin
the pictures we been paintin my nigga
connected to a higher power how i know cause i don't write this shit i think it my nigga
look all i ever did was beat the odds
cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
never stoppin like we hypnotized watch what we visualize on the rise
be the goat while we alive when we die we gon' be the gods




if she was flavor i won't save her/savor
no taste buds hoe later
fuck you lookin at hater
i "saw dem eyes"/sodomize like an ass raper
try to copy my swag like a cheatin classmate
i'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
when you get your fuckin ass graded like a math paper
so ahead of my time "late" means i'm early
my age is reversing i'm basically 30
amazingly sturdy zany and wordy brainy and nerdy
blatantly dirty insanely perverted rapey and scurvy
they blame me for murdering jamie lee curtis said i put her face in the furnace
beat her with a space heater a piece of furniture egg beater thermos
 it may be disturbing
what i'm saying's cringeworthy but i'm urinating on fergie
call shady number 81 surely
i'm turning into the aaron hernandez of rap state of emergency
the planet's havin panic attacks brady's returning
matter of fact i may be deserving of a pat on the back like a patriots jersey
 inexplicable stomach growl
from the pit of it like a fuckin terrier hid in it
despicable dumb it down ridiculous tongue is foul
shoot off at the fuckin mouth like a missile a thunder cloud
hundred pound pistol pull the trigger this gun'll sound
and you'll get a round like digital underground
and fuck ann coulter with a klan poster
with a lamp post door handle shutter
a damn bolt cutter a sandal a can opener
a candle rubber piano a flannel sucker
some hand soap butter a banjo and manhole cover
hand over the mouth and nose smother
trample ran over the tramp with the land rover
the van the lambo hummer and road runner go ham donut
or go rambo gotta make an example of her
that's for sandra bland hoe and philando
hannibal on the lamb no wonder i am so stubborn
i'm anti can't no government
handle a commando your man don't want it
trump's a bitch i'll make his whole brand go under 
and tell dre i'm meeting him
in la white bronco like elway speeding i'm
'bout to run over a chick del rey cd in
 females stay beatin him
bet you they'll lay bleeding and yell "wait" pleading but
screaming is pointless like feeding michel'le helium
leaving him pale faced medium sized welt straight
treating him like a cellmate seedy i'm climbin hell's gate
bitch i'm like your problems self made
meaning someone else's help ain't needed
cause i'ma

hit some of this cali guido
listen to some muthafuckin' 
everybody got a little story they gotta tell
niggaz ain't heard my shithahaha
the life of bizarrewhat
 

hip hop that's the way of life 
if you think you're nice then go grab the mic 
let me tell you my story 'cause everybody got one
grab a pen and pad and start to jot some
always told myself that i would never be losin'
man i ain't had no hood my mother was always movin' 
from detroit to texas texas to detroit 
god damn mama what's the point 
so i would go in my room and pack my little bags 
jump in the truck with my step dad
when i was ten years old i started to feel the hunger
got a little older man the force got stronger 
and me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
so he picked up and started a group with some other guys 
this is hip hopman i won't stop
yo big boi  gimme a beatbox
*beatbox*
 

hip hop hip hop
hip hop
hip hop
hip hop
 

from the hip hop shop to maurice malone 
ten years later i'm still in the zone 
7 mile and  where a star was born 
united we stand divided we swore 
and hell yeah i lived in my car 
bitch i was homeless i would have slept in a jar 
and dirty management i wish all the best
but me and my niggas we had to do what's best 
it was a mess all them taxes and accounts 
checks started to bounce niggas couldn't buy an ounce 
and now that we platinum they diss our name 
like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
and beef sometimes you don't have a choice
to the fight with whitey ford to the beef with royce 
to the ja rules benzinos and niggas in the club
to the e dubs and niggas you ain't heard of
and man i don't know how to use a gun 
but i'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come
 

 

man i thought this was supposed to be hip hop hip hop
i'd rather be fishin' in flip flops flip flops
or cross over to country like kid rock did i
can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
riff that willie nelson lifted from bob seger 
when i was younger i was so eager
to have a gun i would do the same
couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
me and my man goofy gary just tryin' to let loose some steam
muthafuckas laughin' 'cause i couldn't aim
so i'd pull the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thang
i used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun
it was a mandatory year up here in michigan
for each bullet if you got no ccw license
i tried to apply for one they said it'd take 5 6 months
what the fuck am i supposed to do mean time when rivals come
hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
now back to what my three bullet theory was
i'm triple platinum i ain't tryin' to catch no murder one
figured i'd shoot to wound probably miss with at least one
but them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
then i'ma say it's self defense how come i had the gun
was because i was at the range on my way back from
this dude approached me on some bullshit
i'd get a year for each bullet at the most
as opposed to havin' a full clip in that
that was my idiotic logic it was basically for safety
but it gave me power and it made me crazy
and psychotic i just got retarded once i got it
thank god it was empty the night that i got caught with it
what the fuck man i thought that it was supposed to be
 

my 44 be giving lyposuctions
i blow a hole through your stomach open it up you'll be spillin your own guts
i'm a mad man a walking trash can
you get beat with my bear hands fuck a last chance
a macmilly will smack you silly
the epitemy of what really can be the definition of misery
i'm never missing im hittin it
i murder mittiney  thumpin and puncturing kidney
they put a nigga on "ripley's" bitches i ain't working
i'm on sick leave i take your ability to breathe 
what a nigga need  is a millimeter to eat
have'em kissing a millipeed or in the street


in a fight i'm first to throw a brick
first to load the clip first to talk shit
but the last one to split when the shit get thick
stupid bitch get hit with the 45th
i'm a ex  who fought in vietnam
every night i'm thinking about a bomb 
my dick so many places all i do is laugh

i would fall for women like you

i'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

i'm used to women think it's nasty
that's they opinion but that ain't my point of view

some of them need to take some lessons
and learn how to fuck like porno bitches do






when i was young i was sprung off the way women used their tongue
i couldn't nut yet but fuck that it was still fun
to look i took vaseline
even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
now i'm grown
 and my bone is so well known hoes wanna get it cloned
shit ain't nothin wrong with you chunkin that monkey
all up on me 'til the whole room's funky
the negative thoughts it's time to change
shit you a woman i'm a man
it's all natural and we're compatible
i'll bend you over knock you down slap that ass a little bit
 but not to hurt
like after havin a full course meal it's the dessert

like j lo in that movie where her husband beat her up 
puss appears to be pregnant swole and wet up

i done caught my second wind let's begin lift your head up
it's the battle of the sexes we can do this shit 'til breakfast
i don't want no mo' babies but i can give you a baby necklace

 w/ ad libs

waaaahhhhhhhooooooooooo 
guess who's back
mommy we're home
say hello to my little friends
dj muggs soul assassins cypress hill
everybody put your hands where my eyes can see


everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
fourty fifty samoans they knowing when d bo was
50 tweezy obie there won't be no hoe in us
they pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
from new york down to texas back up to los angeles
we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
it's funny i guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
it's just that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
we just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
you fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in we ain't even gon be in it
no one's gunna hear nothing no one's gunna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it them boys is bout it bout it
the noise from  be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened
nobody saw it happen all cause your jaws are flapping
and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
it ain't about the music no more it's bout trying to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off


shit's about to change cause we ain't playing no games
we ain't budging neither are they we ain't saying no names
shit just ain't the same when the k's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop cause those days are gone
it ain't about trying rip shots to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911


step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
all theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
thinking you coming with heat yo son i'm curious
how long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us
some people can never fade us that make us so furious
mistake us for fakers homie we greater and glorious
we living for real and others just making the stories up
allusions are broken so live it up you corny fucks
if you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
when you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one spraying you bitches til there is none
i'm like a rolling stone homie i got you under my thumb
silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
we cut you and give you stitches for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget you're clocking a small digit
dealing with the giant goliath people that's how we live it c'mon




uh gangsta ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
on this shit you call hip hop this function is where did it
when i   put it in motion my focus is getting branded
my appetite for destruction is blasted because i said it
got you   stumbling for cover this music dying in numbers
but you wouldn't pause and wonder admitting it's all glamour
when you   enter the business you thinking you running shit
you witness that funny shit your bitches they ain't shit
we gangstas we blast first ask questions later
all these   imitators parading like they some playas
trying to   save hip hop the task is something greater
cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught i'm not telling or more like killing not caring
i'm riding a   gangsta feeling no fearing when gangstas dying
i'm in a   full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
on an 8 mile mission with cypress and og's


turn my mic up

no need to cook up the coke you see we chop raw
and if you ain't had enough
what in the fat fishes of a phenomenal fahrvergnügen fuck is goin on
back with the ba baracus callous bang on another song
i'ma have these niggaz nervous and clippin they nails
and dribblin and witness 'em nibble 'em like sunflower seed shells
see these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
and i shit on these males 'til it's stinkin fouler than the weed smell
nigga your tree fell see how they twitter facebook and instagram'in a e mail
talkin i'm sick i got 'em shook and i bang 'em at retail
until they cripple see i cook like i'm slangin a weed sale
until i triple bread and whoop 'em and drag 'em like females
 oh see well
these niggaz already know the way that i fuck shit up minus the details
the case is shut your bitch remind me of replacement butt
kind of an ancient slut it's goin down like she was a basement fuck
swell up they shit like i'm stickin steaks in they gut
so gracefully and graciously i painfully wake niggaz up
ragdollin these niggaz and attackin like apes in the cut
i'm waitin for the takin while i break niggaz neck like a bracelet fuck
it's kinda like me havin a case in the truck
and drinkin 'til i'm blasted harassin and erase a nigga what
keepin 'em open i'm blackin until i'm leavin 'em stuck
and got 'em happier than a child in a park chasin a duck
when i'm chasin a buck these funny niggaz be chasin they luck
i be lacin 'em up like boots while i'm pushin they face in the mud 
missiles i fling while i spit live wire 'til this shit circlin back around
with more fire for me to melt a brick surfacin back a sound
while i light up shit that'll cause a quick worship and gather around
it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques painful and make 'em scatter 
shameful the way i shatter  shit apart it doesn't matter
 your head up off your shoulders  bullets bigger than a boulder
and they break 'em and they know it's

while i bite the beat up and i'm startin to heat up 
and i'm choppin your foot off now it's mine and i'm puttin my feet up

and i been blackin out so long niggaz is askin if the hook had died
nah but the beat is fried

 aiyyo calm down nigga
 aiyyo calm down nigga
 




apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
it just might make you sick so irate with this my brain is just like a fuckin fried egg
is my mind scrambled cause i'm lit/omelet narrow minded but go through such a wide range
of this emotion that my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
i just pulled up in clive davis' driveway
with his personal memoir sayin he's bi wavin a nine a
picket sign egging his ride makin him cry "rape" then arrive naked
and drive straight through the gay pride parade gate yippee ki yay
cause here i   wait did the world just pee on my leg
and should i take it as a sign maybe to take 'em back into time 
stuck out like a sore thumb so i gave 'em the finger
to take the attention away from my stinkin face it was bringin
changed the whole complexion of the game but just in case you was thinkin
an inklin of replacin the kingpin of crazy you're wastin your ink then
so if this is any indication of what you may be facin
you better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
are leavin a bad taste fuck makin a bad impression
that's the worst impersonation i've ever seen and
who raps nasally eyes hazily rhymes crazily
but sounds like he may need some flonase when he's speakin
what kind of stupid question is that "hey mrs abraham lincoln
other than your husband's fuckin brains that were leakin how'd you think that play was this weekend"
you ain't the real slim shady sit your ass down
faggot see me on a ballot i'm runnin for class clown
rich democrat bitch so i'm just a candidate
to come fuck up the whole party me and flipmode starting a campaign
to have every campus on a fuckin rampage
act my goddamn age i am eight
so let's get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed covered in band aids
glass ashtray smashed champagne splashed on the lampshades
but this ain't up for debate this is un debatable
shady for president hoe don't make me go
take it back to the days of old with sway and tech radio
when i was takin so much no doz and lsd i almost fell asleep on "the wake up show"
fuck you telling me fools i was rippin shop raising hell up in drew's
when penelope cruz was still developing boobs
me and bust put it down like a sick pet you're fuckin with vets dawg
fuckin internet bloggers
"i sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
everything i'm an expert on everything everything sucks play the next song"
guess if i hopped out your freakin laptop you idiot prick
with biggie and kicked the living shit out you i'd be dead wrong
son of god i'm the sog like a wet log
pores never get clogged cause i'm so full of self esteem that i sweat fog
 yes yes y'all 
steady on the left y'all step off 'fore you get stepped on
soft 'bout as commercial as my fuckin learjet
jealously'll get you green as a chia pet i can see that you're visibly upset dawg
alert alert girl alert
once you enter in my house of pain you're in a world of hurt
so  get that ass shakin
 came to hit you with a fan favorite
but if you're too fly for coach better get them arms and frickin hands flailin
and  like van halen and pray for a damn tailwind
more afraid of success than i am failure
so what does that tell ya
that on a grand scale i don't give a fuck about nothin like stan mailin
his last piece of fanmail 'fore he ran straight into the damn railin

militant in a sense i don't really give a shit
call up eminem i gotta plead innocent




sixteenth in my sneakers i ain't listen to my teachers
i'm the most hated nigga alive since jesus
maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my christ like abilities
come back then ride on my enemies
never been afraid of beef metals of my bravery
war situations got you sayin he crazy g
and emerge with the beat i can serve anything
especially anybody tryin to diss my team  shady
 g unit aftermath the same thing
so if you say them punk nigga you say me
i be in la g get at me when you see me
catch you in oc and in the bag you'll be leaving
i ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
is worth e'rything it's on bbgn
i son'd you folk i'm lookin at your pinkie
you a fake ass gangsta what a waste of my scenery

  2x


maybe i just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
shady  we gotta push 'em to the back
move 'em along push 'em aside don't get me wrong
i love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
it's got a catch but come on man the raps
we all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
who walk around with their chest out
just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
better be down with them huh
but i dare some bitch to say somethin about eminem
cause i'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
i already seen two friends get shot in the head
and lay on the ground this year and one didn't make it
proof you are the truth
please don't let us come face to face with these boo boo hoo
fake ass tattooed havin
fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
for me to try and stay out it
but they just won't quit runnin their mouth
at least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch
we all got shooters yeah these days who doesn't
and as far as the snaps and claps i wasn't
dissin the south that isn't what this is about
i just so sick of the beef i don't even wanna see anymore

  2x
i live in a world that's different than your world
your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
those things don't exist in my world anymore
welcome to my world
welcome to planet x motherfucker


it used to be parks
it used to be jungle gyms
now they just stories passed down orally
from my great grandmother an' 'em
it used to be public pools
kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
you could blame the government
let me tell you how it all started
the middle class was evaporated
then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt poor
of course who had the world oversaturated
so a new world order was activated
no more black no more white no more brown no more yellow no more red
just high born citizens and low born citizens
and all that race shit was eradicated
you're either rich or you're poor now
digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
bein poor is like fightin a war now
no energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
livin life on a tight rope
but the trickery is the tight rope it's slippery as a ice slope
every second somebody is fallin off
so we figure we embrace the misery nigga we never liked hope
cause hope was the buzzword
that they use to brainwash us fuck that we unlearn
now the rich people concerned
cause they know our return is confirmed by holdin a gun firm
what's that in the distance
you fucked the slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
you scared lookin out your window
you see your own fuckin children crawlin over your fences


one by one they all come slow to meet their fates
two by two i bury them in their shallow graves
three by three they've come at me their guns and swords were drawn
now four by four before the lord they'll choose a witchy spawn
cause we're coming for you 
la la la la la we're coming for you
la la la la la we're coming for you


yo what you gon' do now
it's too late for talkin i'm in your face with the tool out
foot wearin the other shoe now
the chickens came home to roost now who got the juice now
aiyyo what you gon' do now
you wanna truce now i'm in your face with the tool out
foot wearin the other shoe now
the chickens came home to roost now who got the juice now

who got the juice now

tell me who got the juice now

who got the juice now

who got the juice

artist: cypress hill f/ eminem noreaga
album:  skull & bones
song:   rap superstar
typed by: acastro929@aolcom


most people don't see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit
i didn't know it
i didn't see it
i never saw it until i was actually in it
you really gotta be in it
to understand what its like
but you always gotta 
people always gotta see your smile
you always gotta put on that fake
you know what i'm sayin
no matter what u just been through


so you wanna be a rap superstar
and live large a big house 
5 cars you're in charge
comin up in the world 
don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly


i remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
to rock crowds make money
chill wit the honies
sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
shits funny
how impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it
never the less you gotta go for the gusto
but you don't know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers
and losin some of your self 
music has past gone by
hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
egomaniac in the brainiac
don't know how to act
shits deep
48 tracks
studio gangsta mack
sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
but never will 
till he crosses over still
feelin no hate 
but  fantasies come wit these
just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
you wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
and take shit from people who don't know what it is
i wish it was all fun and games 
but the price of fame is high
and some can't pay to play
trapped in what you rappin about
tell me what happened when you lost clout
the rout you took started collapsing 
no fans
no fame
no respect
no change
no women
and everyone shits on your name


so you wanna be a rap superstar 
and live large
a big house 
5 cars 
the rent charged
comin up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly
to be a rap superstar
and live large
a big house 
5 cars 
the rent charged
comin up in the world don't trust nobody
gotta look over your shoulder constantly


when you sign to a record label
you don't know you sign  your life over
and these whiteboys don't care about you
cuz the minute you fall off
they'll find another noreaga
and they'll find another capone n noreaga
and they'll find another b real
so you  need to just keep 
stack your chips up
do what you gotta do while your hot
and mafuckin get out the game
stick to the drug game
and the drug game is even worse
because if someone jerks you 
you can shoot em and kill me
but in this game if someone jerks you
you gotta be humble


no matter what you just been through
shit has gotta be right
you gotta approach people
you gotta be on the up and up
and everything gotta be all good
when you see someone slap hands with em
you know what i'm sayin give em a pound
or whatever it is
but you always gotta act like it ain't shit




my own son don't know me
sittin up in the hotel room lonley
but i thank god i'm wit my homies
but sometimes i wish i was back home
but only no radio or videos
cuz they show me no love
the phony gotta hit the road slowly
so the record gets pushed by sony
i'm in the middle like monie
and the press say that
my own people disowned me
and the best way back
is to keep your head straight
never inflate the cranium
your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
who just wanna cling on swing on
and so on and go on and fall off
the hoes fall off
to the next rap superstar 
wit no shame give him a year
and they'll be right out the game
the same as the last one
who came before him
gained fame
started gettin ignored
i warned him
assured him
this ain't easy take it from weezy 
sleezy people wanna be cheesey
they talkin evil

wake your motherfuckin asses up
aiyyo what if so what
well come on then you know what time it is

for whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my ass whipped
cause i'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
i just can't get passed these little piss ants
that wanna be barney bad asses so bad
and they so mad they can't stand it cause we can and they can't spit
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens and i snap then it's a wrap
then it's a scrap and it isn't rap is it
hip hop isn't a sport anymore
when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm old fashioned but my passion
is to smash anyone rappin without havin to slap him
believe me i'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
when i'm pissed now but it all depends on just how
far it gets took on the mic
cause i'm tellin you right now you're not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin you with me
you poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit b
your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
cause they just bounce off me like bullets do 50
i'm the beautiful instinct and you're gonna miss me
when i'm gone like keith murray when he threw his stool
and hit a girl accidentally 
i do this with swifty kon and kuniva bizzy and proof   are you with me


well c'mon then everybody good mornin

so ever sing along with the words of the song and
if you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
everybody good mornin


they consider me the epitomy of a beef starter
in the party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
fuck snubs i walk in clubs with a shotgun
constantly poppin slugs they hot son better not run 
the bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
in a house full of dog shit
i'm a gothic death prophet you'll stop breathin
you'll die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
it ain't about what you readin
when you meet me better speak like it's seasons greetings
either that or we'll be beefin frequent
you niggaz need an e just to speak shit
and your heater is a petite bitch
keep the heater where you can reach quick
i'll snipe you with it and won't even keep it a secret
nigga i did it from the mind of a mental patient
when glocks sway you can save that conversation for satan
you brave




yo yo   i heard you niggaz
don't like us but so what this beef is like what the fuck
did he say in his rap   am i conceded  he just a punk
i mean these niggaz'll squeeze on me pleased when seein guts
i don't need no enemies cause my family a couple trucks
and my  and a mic they empty out on them bike
to fight you in front of everyone important that i don't like
no need for metaphors to get points across when i write
this emotion's enough to say "fuck you bitch and i don't like you"
what  i might as well give this up but that'd be selfish as fuck
you'll leave d12 in this but we can't self destruct
i've never felt it this much c'mon fellas get up
we gotta fight like bugz last night of his life c'mon


i walk with a limp pistol hangin off of the hip
i'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparkin a fifth
your carcass is split even if beef is partially thick
we can't take you serious you a comedy skit
you probably wish that you could be out shootin at g's
but the only thing you shoot is the breeze i can't believe
you speakin on movin ki's but every time we hear you kick it
the only thing that you sellin is woof tickets
i look wicked cause niggaz'll test your nut sack
so when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped
outta your stomach and when they want it
i'll bring a hundred niggaz from runyon so get to gunnin if you comin


yeah homie

better get it through your brain
when you say my name never say it in vain cause i'm a psycho


we fuckin' crazy

i'm a motherfuckin' omen i bow down to no man

a soldier with a motive scrotum big as boulders
i hold 'em then unload on you put it on a poster
so everyone can notice who was focused on us
pokin' they nose in our business hopin' that i don't come smoke 'em
no one knows my notions or emotions i'm a vulture
you niggaz close to croakin' any moment and i know when
i could fuck the culture up probably rap
a maniac wit' anxiety attacks i don't wanna chat
speak when you spoken to
and i don't have to read a fuckin' magazine or quotable
to notice what you ho's will do


we all soldiers
we move as a unit we all roll up
and show up at your residence light your front door up
get scared life ain't fair
and i'm prepared to blast you just as fast as dre can say "hell yeah"
so watch what you say
cause it can happen either today or the next minute
i can draw the heater and spray and i'm dead serious
you could be dead period end of story
i'm on your porch wit' a gun and your son sippin' a forty
nobody can hold me i does it all by my lonely
i stomp your head when you awake you be looking like gumby
aftermath and shady bitch you can read it and weep
you see my poster in the 'hood for the "g of the week"


i'm a little bit off the chain call me insane
but the fact remains that i'm a psycho

better get it through your brain
when you say my name never say it in vain cause i'm a psycho



they found saddam but they ain't gonna find me
i'll be under a tree in buttfuck tennessee
and i don't know too much about my daddy
except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
i ain't a racist i just hate whites
fags and dykes blacks and tranvestites
thirteen years old and joined a fuckin' gang
hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fuckin' pain
am i insane who really knows
cause any second my temper can fuckin' blow
i get colder than december
black the fuck out tomorrow won't even remember
see bizarre can show you what violence is all about
and this dr dre beat done brought it the fuck out
run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
and blow your brains the fuck out


i probably got a screw loose or two or maybe three or four of 'em
some fell out and hit the floor
all i know is ever since my fuckin' head hit the snowbank
i been a little neanderthalish no thanks to my man d'angelo bailey
but i just take it slow daily my biggest dilemma's
tryin' to figure whether to use the flat head or the phillips
or just go to the home depot and pick the new power drill up
gives me two hours and six days and i'm still up
i feel like i'm about to snap any minute
there's a new tower records about to stop and get a fill up
pick the new cypress hill up
and go find who did that shit to xzibit
and go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
and shatter his fuckin lips wit' it


i'm a little bit off the chain call me insane
but the fact remains that i'm a psycho
better get it through your brain
when you say my name never say it in vain cause i'm a psycho

runyan ave soldiers amityville
who the fuck want it with usnobody
dawg i shouldn't have left
they wouldn't have tried that shit if i was witchu
maybe we would've picked another time or maybe chose another way
or maybe my prayers would've convinced him to choose another soul
shiiit it's just me and man tony now
man you look so peaceful right now
how can i argue with that
they say that the good die young


they say that the good die young 
that's why i think that you should have fun 
cause time won't wait for no one 
when god calls you gotta go home 
they say the good die young 
that's why i know that we gon' have fun 
in this life cuz you only get one
when god call for me don't cry i just went home


yo i'm sure that everybody heard they momma say it be days like this
when you see one of your friends die in the mist
in the struggle into the circumstances
a risk that they take just to prove a point to a friend
even then accidents are prone to happen
to any man or woman that's dumb enough to pretend it
huh god will hold 'em accountable for sins
that they commit and they try to repent the sins to repent
but  i guess that's the way things go
i was blessed to see twenty fo'
to wake up to that "hi my name is" video
motivated me to write what i wrote
and i knew my little brother sold dope
and mom and daddy wanted to move our row
i did it  i still got a lot to prove and show
i just wish we ain't have to lose bugz through the struggle
cause you know




i know you used to bizarre on some silly shit
but niggaz in my clique   is dyin quick 
in detriot niggaz don't party
they pull a fo' fo' out snatch off ducartis
that's why i keep the pistol under the truck
i'm 27 years old too old to be gettin jumped
and fuck rap i miss karnail pitts
b u g z tatted on my wrist
me and you in the jeep listen to  beats
it's a shame me and fuzz don't even speak
i got married my wife name is dee
peace to 31 and 5150 bitch


yo i think back on that tragic day my phone rung
and bizarre's voice tellin me bugz was goin home
it was like a knife piercin my chest and i couldn't breathe
i didn't wanna accept it didn't wanna believe it
i swear at his wake dawg i cried so hard
literally   denaun had to carry me to the car
while i stand in this booth now it's tearin me apart
but i had to let it out cause it was tearin at my heart
cause he died over somethin so petty and so small
a human life is so very precious i hope y'all
understand how i'm feelin cause i love you bugz
i wanna rhyme witchu laugh witchu hug you bugz
but i can't and you were so close to see your dreams
a coward came along and took you away from the team
so don't mistake this track as just another song
this goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
cause you know




they say it's never too late to have an early childhood
if i could turn back the hands of time god should
forgive what i did as a kid that run blocks
now my dreams is just scream "cops" and gunshots
the fun stops when your homie's up in the box
my duty bo rest assure snuffed by the cops
i used to court shit a lot if there's a guy i'd pprobably say somethin
if you love him so much why ain't you gave nothin
but he took my homie's slippers only in eleventh grade
now i hope to see his face at the heaven gates
it ain't never late in the game satan remains
with a grudge to see slugs break through my frame
my heart aches with the pain the light limits breath
we gotta have fun now there's only minutes left
and in death cause stress young'uns is sucked in
to get tats for my fallen homies i ain't got enough skin
yes y'all




when i was younger i knew fo' brothers that wasn't wise
that crashed and the driver died
my partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
and i'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other two survived
nine months later another one dies
somebody shot him in his side when he was startin up his ride 
three years go by i made a hell of a run
and that's when funky got done joey playin with guns
and tookie over funds cardie was my man
and reggie i wish that i was witchu in that van
and bugz if it wasn't for you
you know i wouldn't be standin in this booth
and that's the truth   i miss y'all

  repeat 2x
so i changed huh you got a phone
pick up and call me


how come we don't even talk no more
and you don't even call no more
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we ain't even beefin now
after all the years we've been down ain't no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family ain't a damn thing changed unless its you


we were so young 
so full of life and vibrance 
side by side wherever you was riding i went
so close almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
when ronnie died you was right by my side 
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
and a bucket to catch ever tear i cried inside it 
you even had the same type of childhood i did 
sometimes i just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
and mine i survived it you ran the streets i 9 to 5ed it 
we grew up grew apart as time went by us 
and i blew up to both yours and mines surprises
now i feel a vibe i just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it
your cold your touch is just like ice 
and your eyes is a look of resentment
i can sense it and i don't like it


how come we don't even talk no more
and you don't even call no more
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we ain't even beefin now
after all the years we've been down ain't no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family ain't a damn thing changed unless its you


it was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse 
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse
fore i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
for i let him disrespect me or check me over some 
worst some bitch that i wasn't with
i woulda hit it and quit
but you were p'aing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
i told you don't get involved with her
you would smoke in the car with her
coming outta the bar with her
stumbling half drunk
like y'all was husband and wife or somethin
but me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
cause you were offin' your mouth to people like you wanted with me
when all i tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
and every sister fares and all the shit that i produced
you acting like i aint your man and lying like she cant be loose
but i am really your friend i'm just trying to tell ya the truth
dont hate the game or the player
the one thats changing is you


how come we don't even talk no more
and you don't even call no more
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we ain't even beefin now
after all the years we've been down ain't no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family ain't a damn thing changed unless its you


its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
now we acting like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch

like my finger get to snappin
and poof it just happen 
but proof is just acting out the part he was thrown 
shady made it so my babies aint starving at home 
see the devil in your glance
since the ghetto we been friends forever real intellegence 
thats forever till the end 
i peep the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lies 
aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
 when you talk it's with bitter and spite
 it's my fault for what you did with your life 
and everytime i go to hear you play you look away 
we barely embrace you cant even look me in my face


how come we don't even talk no more
and you don't even call no more
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine we ain't even beefin now
after all the years we've been down ain't no way no how
this bullshit cant be true
we family ain't a damn thing changed unless its you daddy

it's my attitude that's makin me bust shit i ain't to be fucked with
so basically niggas wastin they time tryin to touch swift

i'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
with a mag and i'll be glad to send another one after you
without no hesitation i run up in your house and wake your spouse up
and give her gun to mouth resuscitation
a niggas information they hunted and they sad

when i'm in my vehicle i'm pullin you in
i gaurantee that the world will never see you again




honest to god i usually try to keep to my self
but it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants well
let me explain somethin to ya a real street nigga

and he ain't the type of dude to pop a e and get drunk
and wave his heat all in the air like he's some gun hoe punk
at least a soldier in the army lose his life for a cause
y'all niggas dyin over pride just to prove he got balls
i play keyboards i dont play beef
you borrow guns i own shit that explode when it hit
you think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin you can't really get sleep
cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vein
i'm a mayne i do my biddin and i do it again
if you take it to that level i take it to whoever
want to harm me and my family runyon ave forever




now people know i live triflin i express it through writin
if you can't feel it then i must express it through fightin
and i just bought me a gauge and added on a new knife
and i strike people so fast people think i threw lightning
clash with a few titans blasted a few hype men
been harassed by two dykes who wanted new 
plus you know i'm too violent to be out with you wilin
cause as soon as you drivin i'm a spit a few five ones
and i love to kunive son and you let the live run
i know how to hide guns skinny or wide ones
go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns

for life as d12 no ice and spreewells
every night that i chill in i fight by free will
knowing i can be killed
leaving my group pieces of proof with a reason to shoot
and a liecense to ill

without forcing our hand

cause i'm like the lead singer of a band dude
and i think everybody's got a fuckin problem with me dude

because


these chicks don't even know the name of my band
but they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
cause once i blow they know that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead singer of my band


so i get off stage right and drop the mic
walk up to the hot chicks and i'm all like
"sup ladies my name's slim shady

they're all like "oh my god it's him"
"becky oh my fucking god it's eminem"
"i swear to fucking god dude you fucking rock"
"please won't you please let me suck your cock"
and by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
especially when i drop the beat and do my acapellas
all the chicks start yelling all the hot babes
throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
so like every single night they pick a fight with me
but when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
cause they're back on stage the next night with me

walkin zombied it's ornery
pullin armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camraderie

hop on a motorcycle bustin wheelies over your chest
bystanders standin by thinkin oh what a mess

you just know   that's the new shit
the type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid


i come to every club with intention to do harm
with a prosthetic arm and smellin like boone's farm
hidin under tables as soon as i hear alarms
paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
connivin kon artis with a bomb
strapped to my stomach screamin "let's get it on"
a lush that love to drink drunk drivin a tank
rollin over a bank cops see me and faint

and i don't give a damn if they white or blue 
speed 'shrooms down the valiums 
even smoke weed outta vacuums
i just copped some and i'm goin back soon




i'm at rave lookin like a slave high off chronic
gin and tonic demonic body smell like vomit
pussy poppin acid droppin dope headed guy
heroin mescaline pencilnecks wanna try
blue pills golden seals got bizarre actin ill
drugs kill    bitch i'm for real
shut your mouth you dirty slut you know you want it in your butt
i'll put it in your cunt; let bizarre nut




dirty dozen eighty of us shady brothers ladies love us
that's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
they probably wanna take each other out and date each other
some  somethin some'un some'un some'un 


i don't wanna go to school i don't need no education
i don't wanna be like you i don't wanna save the nation 
i just wanna live my life everyday a celebration
one day i'ma leave this world i'm waitin for the revelation


i wanna kill myself  i'm still debatin
in front of a baptist church masturbatin
prayin to satan   think i'm crazy cause i smoke crack
live on b with the mac in a two family flat 
tired of gettin hit in the face with a broom
my moms on her period my dad's in my room 
i got ten rocks and i need to get out
i sold them in five minutes at my own damn house 
my poor grandmother god bless her soul
the bitch got aids  she just waitin to die of a cold 
there's three things that keep me from bein a nazi
i'm black a fag and my dad's liberace


no matter how bad the beatin i went to school cheatin
my dad whooped my ass at a pta meetin
stick with school i had to have nuts just to do it
got bored and became truant
when i had the gall to go i just couldn't do it
i was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
how would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
gettin threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
like me outcast last in class
first to leave when the teacher called on me
best believe i had somethin up my sleeve


i've been praised and labelled as crazed
my mother was unable to raise me full of crazy rage
an angry teenager nothin can change me back
gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
i was boostin so influenced by music i used it
as an excuse to do shit ooh i was stupid
no one can tell me nothin hip hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
it was like isolatin myself was healthy
it felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
compelled me to excel when school it failed me
expelled me and when the principal would tell me
i was nothin and i wouldn't amount to shit
i made my first million and counted it
now look at a fuckin drop out that quits
stupid as shit rich as fuck and proud of it
that's why




i was raised with a rifle and mask
steadily beatin my psychiatrist ass just for askin about my past
 i was never on that punk shit; fuckin around
can get yo' belove abducted smothered in blood quick
you couldn't pay swift to give a fuck
was crazy like my father it musta been poison in that nigga's nut
far as probation fuck peein in cups
i violate at any time let 'em see the blunt
i grew up steadily masturbatin inside of cells
young as hell havin conversations with myself
you could tell i wasn't lenient a disobedient
lynched and slapped teachers bitch i'm not readin it
you don't know what dawgs go through a little nigga
sippin liquor with my old dude what the fuck you gon' do
i'm quick to curse you i told my mother that i'ma hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew


look my family ignored me and i don't like that
they don't even listen when i tell them i'll be right back
 this nice beautiful house ma it don't mean shit
cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
and yesterday he hit me like a grown fuckin man
i couldn't stand up to him i just ducked and ran
i'm sick of this i wish on christmas
that i can get a loaded four fifth and put a fuckin end to this
 i got no friends and i can't get a bitch
only thing i have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
nothin to smile about i'm about to lose my mind
got me an automatic nine now i'm ballin out


wait 'til school's over pu pil are people to shoot through
kids goin cuckoo with a two two
since my friend is this new dude in this high school
losin his noodle learn that people don't like you
the football jocks is spittin on him
popular kids in school is now pickin on him
burn out youngsta niggaz now hittin on him
and his teacher in his english class keep flippin on him
and now he's grounded with no allowances
for drinkin forty ounces cause he was caught by his counselors
and why the fuck i gotta ride the bench coach
already got expelled for wearin a trenchcoat
all i ever seen is 
told me to keep silent stop battin my eyelids
it's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
that's why i blew out my brains and murdered you all


yo yo huh yo yo yo
that's right motherfuckers we back
same slangin orangatangin wildin out on hoodrats
they say i act like i'm too famous to say hi
and tell 'em what my name is but really i'm still nameless
you niggaz don't get it yet do you
dealin out platinum or flop i still put it through you
wit a luger that'll spit fire
and hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like mariah
you think for one second since we got a deal
that we won't deal wit you in front of st andrew's still
you gay rappers better learn that
i won't stop until i see 'em turn back
if you don't slow that roll you got
you gon see these runyan ave niggaz that really need some prozac
fo' sho' that ask the others
brigade'll lay you down next to your mother's mother's grandmother


you know i'm feelin real rowdy tonight

i kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom 
you and your madame it's really unexplainable how i have 'em
who call theyself screamin about a challenge 
nigga we got a gift while you barely makin it off mere talent
my skills are deeply embedded even your hoe said it 
she was knock kneed i fucked her now she's bow legged
in the middle of rappin i drop the mic 
and have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrappin 
kuniv' and kon artis my nigga we get it crackin
while the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughin

hook: 1  in background

cause niggaz ain't fuckin around no more man 


the feds can't hold me i hold feds
i was born with a dark ass cloud over my head
rainin acid you can't refrain from gettin yo' ass kicked
cause you talk too much   you asked for it
i'm on some massive shit everybody ignore me
they wouldn't fuck with me if i was performin at an orgy
these niggaz get confronted  then they change stories
i cut you and they thinkin everything's hunky dory
i even have you pourin me the gasoline for me
pullin up slowly cocktailin your homie 
you met a lot of niggaz but you wouldn't wanna know me 
yo' ass might not even make it home wit your roley
don't even try in your system like e coli
tryin to beef with me nigga please yo' people die
i'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
i survived the abortion immediately surprise aaaaah


picture me sittin in a jail cell rottin 
or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
so when the  come knockin each hand's got one
cocked ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
one man army guns can't harm me
young and ornery worse than my uncle ronnie
ever since i got my first gun pulled on me
i can't stop airin out my dirty laundry
middle fingers flipped and censorship
your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
ever since i spit some shit on "infinite"
i been givin it a hundred and ten percent
cause when i'm bent   most of my energy's spent on enemies
eighty percent of what i invent is hennessey
twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
ten's because i love being under your skin
yeah shit can happen so stick to rappin
quit the yappin or i'ma lift the mac and
that can lead to another mishap happenin
skip the crap get the can of whoop ass crackin

hook

and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
a rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
nine millimeters five criminals pulling heaters 
and spilling liters of blood like swimmin pools
shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too 
a lot of people say misoginistic which is true

it's crazy


it's because of these drugs that i do that make me
do these things that i do do these things that i do


my music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
it's like lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
you probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
it's got the power to get you to do it 
so when the shit comes on i wanna see some shit jump off
some bitch get slapped some motherfuckin kid get stomped
so get this song go run out and buy this disc
and try this shit as much coke as i just did
cause times like these got me doin lines like these
plus i grab a pencil every time that i light weed
it's probably because of the drugs shady does what he does
and is what he is i'm dizzy bizzy visit these kids


hey stephanie  let's take some ecstasy 
now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
 'til i'm dead i'm takin blunts to the head

these mescalines got me sure
that i can fuck any whore with genital warts on the warped tour

sniffin 'caine at celebrity basketball games

eight years old swallowin anacins standin over my bannister
laughin with a chromed out caliber 
the weed that i'm sellin this  look like the back of a tarantula
i keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my acura
smashin it after framin a nigga with smack and dust
i'm scandalous drugs been ran for months
crackin capsules to expand our blunts

until they find me on a stretcher
i'm quick to sample anything bitch you got a tester
this crank'll have me blowin up banks like uncle fester

ghetto kings meddling with the smell of greens
got a jell o spleen and see yellow rings 
blue pills and purple mushrooms

two tabs of x and vitamin c
swallow hennessey along with tylenol 3
grindin the teeth at the signs of the e
i lost six days at a time in the week
the crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
while d 12 gang rape marilyn manson
in twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
barf up my stomach linin drown in my vomit

   25x


cause i like i always tell people   yknowhati'msayin like
if you got an addiction don't admit to nobody yknowhati'msayin
keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that yknahmsayin
when you're out in the public eye and shit
they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
that's why i always tell my friends knowhati'msayin but
i mean like for me i don't give a fuck
i'll probably end up dyin from this shit one day
probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
"eminem dies from drug overdose"   youknowhati'msayin and
and my friends they ain't no fuckin better yknowhati'msayin

cause the only motherfuckers gonna die tonight 
they say that one little lie turns into another then you go and cheat
by the time you know it you are wrapped up in a whole bunch of seaweed
you shoulda listened to your mama and listened to your daddy when they tried to speak
and tell you that there's just too many fishes in the sea


no no no no no no no no


now this thing here it may cause concern but
it's just a little story bout a shark eatin worms
it's not a riddle but subliminally catches on
how one little lie can turn into a bigger one
when i was a young guppy in the sea
you could see all the bigger fish pickin on me
cause they knew i didn't really have the guard or bullet
and the other sharks that have teeth sharper than me
i'm a never endin story about a shark this big
the load of kids that got an act for fizz
so sit back kick back with a bag of chips
while i tell you bout something stupid i did




i'm off to work but i'm late  but what can i say 
i'm cool with the boss and then of course it's a payday
we reachin the weekend and i'll be treatin my baby
typical day dude's in the way  but hey wait
shark's in the water gotta duck in the corner
'til i'm caught i'ma talk and i walk where i wanna
hittin the seaweed sippin this green tea
big fish in this small world they'll all believe me
for knocking a shark off protecting my city
they all grab my cd and now i'm a popular rock star
like it or not though i'm a marvelous artist
working my hardest and becoming a starfish


now what am i to do the boss is on my back
i gotta follow his orders when sharks attack
it's a dangerous scene but i'm a rasta man
cross me and my brother it will cost ya man
and this little pipsqueak is gettin' on my nerves
so my tentacles should give him just what he deserves
so you better swim fast cause i'm after ya
and go and hide inside the mouth of a clam or somethin'
cause i'm out and about   i'm bad news a henchman
a jellyfish with an attitude so listen
swim for your life cause i'm on your tail
so frightenin i scare a snail out of its shell




i love this liquid i'm silly when i'm in it and i bet

duh  what do you expect from me
i'm a platinum jack dempsey trying to get a fee
and everybody know that i'm the g of the sea
i just knocked this shark off   the dude tried to eat me
i guess he didn't like me it might be because i'm a pisces
they always try to take me lightly
so why the trouble i just wanna hustle
and multiply bubbles and pump my muscles
i don't want to make a mistake
cause these fishermen will set you up and i ain't fallin for the bait




i'm a lionfish with dreams of makin it big
house in the ocean three ugly kids
and why everybody keep on pickin on me
i'm the sexiest prettiest fish in the sea
heck no i ain't nobody dish
cause i'm in love with angie  the beautiful angelfish
 give me a kiss baby
i'm running from the white shark you tryin to make me crazy

the plan is to throw the ball to swift
but he's so god dang high that he's trips
falls and slips proof grabs him by his fingertips
and runs the ball all the way down to the one
but he don't get in but all we need is a put 
but all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
but then i get sacked all the way back to the ten
god dammit i'ma slap somebody if i get tapped on the ass again

wide reciever recievin' wide
for every stride in my life yo i breathe and die


defense is playin' a pass
then the quarterback peeps and screams 
that means that its time for me
to run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
my tracks burn turf when they excell
i try to lateral pass the ball to proof
he got dropped and the ball came loose
and shot up like a flare i gave the ball a stare
and use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
now i'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
i can use this pose for a box of cereal
i'm no joke punk i get my dinero
for bein' the best player on my team what

the nastiest band with gas in each hand
we never bow down to be a flash in the pan
no remorse fuck ya stature dog
nothin' to do with hands when i clap at y'all
put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
then i'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
so we can battle with raps we can battle with gats
matter of fact we can battle for plaques 


i'm too fuckin' retarded
i don't give a fuck about my dick
that's why i'm datin' lorraina bobbet
my crew had an argument who was the largest
now they all is dead and i roll as a solo artist
plus i made all the beats and wrote all the raps
well i really didn't but i did accordin' to this contract
i was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
freezin' 20 below forced to join bel biv devoe
my little girl she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
that's why i glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
if rap don't work i'm startin' a group with garth brooks
hahahaha 50 sing the hook


this rap game this rap game
i ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
and i ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
man i'm tellin' you know it ain't happening
this rap game this rap game
i ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
i ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
this rap game this rap game
now when you reppin' in these streets say it
and if you handlin' your beef say it
you got your hood on lock say
if it's crime on your block say


i put men on canvas
have they ass off the street cancerous
we call that the "hammer dancers"
that's the 3 5 7 now the feds want us
cause we lead dump and head hunters
borough of every hood in this crime life
my name painted on the block or this limelight
a g ain't nuthin' but a letter you can hang man
and these gang wars though out the gang lands
got no problem with hurtin' a church
my model was murking 'em first
when they said they servin' their turf
with no sea food make 'em see through
i'm into slappin' niggas next nigga


me too
my eliminations way too hasty they don't chase me 
i send more red dots than pastries
when the medal is sworn label me the desolate one
it ain't no settlin' beef i'm destined to come
to any hood it ain't no justice you wishin' it was
this crime life got me stealin' your goods
i'm a mental patient on the way to the central station
ain't no wastin' time and i'm sure i ain't facin' time
breaker 1 9 the narcs be swarmim'
on they walkie talkies tryin' to block me with a warnin'
i'mma disappear like spawn and be gone
to the other side of the country by the morning
yeah


now when you reppin' in these streets say it
and if you handlin' your beef say it
you got your hood on lock say
if it's crime on your block say



cold nights in the pen turn a heart cold
cold pinches we sleep on keep a back strong
my brother told me "lil' homie don't get this wrong
if i get locked make sure you keep the dough flowin'
the spots oweing no slowin' get your grind on"
i said "fa sho" and now you know i got the hood slowed
my lil' bro keep up the front like he the one that owe
by the time they figure out i'll be dead and gone


now be careful when you see them homies hop out that ride
how you can catch a body shot and knock your ribs out your side
and the cops are hesitant to come through these parts here
we head hunters so it's evident that we spark fear
token notes but always give it to a person in need
of a serious chin checkin' and we're cursin' indeed
to get our point across clearly ain't no misunderstandin'
now there's nothin' you can do to keep these missles from landin'
when the hooligans come out you should be runnin' for cover
by the time you recover from a hit then here comes another
and you know our presence is felt like christmas eve
make an example out of you for her and his to see boy


come to your car window  you and your boys get out 
ak tech nine shots rang out
it's christmas time my kid need some toys
that's why i'm in the mini van with two of my boys 
the king nigga i'm a don
detroit: where niggas snatch cartneys and alcazon
i'm drunk as  go lock me out
and when i wake up i'll be at your house chalkin' you out
i'm so  out of my mind
a muslim that eats swines with two and a half lines
street wars my niggas ready to fight
guns pipes we ready tonight


now when you reppin' in these streets say it
and if you handlin your beef say it

by the age of aquarius
my mind state was gregarious
various opponents whose stature was hilarious
like you
throwing fairy dust
then frowning hard on whack chorus
proof was on the scene before nat morris
cold as a black forest in these starving streets
a garbage heap that was brought
stars could eat
the nerve of haters
diss us perging gators
so i spit venom at you through your serve in vegas
the primitive fool again
none can match that
blast at your rib cage
making your spine hatch back
you lack fat tactics
and thoughts of dexatrim
whippin' my dick out on nuns
if they say sex is sin
next to slim
i'm shady as a tetris win
dirty dozen solo are respected men
get known for craft
irritate me like infected skin
the future ain't lookin' the same
like a neglected twin
some test the scary
that's unnecessary
to kill your crew family your friends
your tech can carry
knock your paws off sync
left you flat like a soft drink
got more styles than diana ross swing
zone like rick james when he smoke crack
you and charli baltimore
got something in common
y'all both whack
proof the king p i n
if i ain't the best this year

nigga i pull the deuce deuce
and my niggas go wild
like a bunch of rats that got loose
i'm comin' for you nigga
so hide behind your door
cuz all my niggas believe in the art of war

chorus 
what you startin' for
is you on for war
trife assassins
bringing you the art of war


straight wylin'
burying bodies right on top of each other
so when somebody ask
i just say you under the weather 
no matter what the problem
revolvers can solve 'em
keep a nigga breathless
the tech whips regardless
heartless
walking you punks right to the edge of darkness
we're way beyond that
when i pull me out a cartridge
i bank shots
wettin' up your white tank top
while my nigga bugz is stickin' up
your nearest gang spot
just another scarred liar retired
we make niggas pass out like fliers
flossin' my teeth with barbed wire
leavin' a bloody mess
then harass kids
and buy 'em a candy bar
so they can tell me where you live


highly dangerous
spraining my wrist
lickin' off this black tech
with my eyes flossed bitch
look up the art of war
in the ghetto dictionary
and see bizarre holding your kids
hostage for their crunch berries
my pump stay hot
coat stomachs like malox
run away spots
setting it off with the guns that dre got
ghetto séance
but ass backwards
fuck bringing you back to life
nigga we putting you in your caskets
running off with the mop like you got somethin'
but in my mind i'm thinking
blast soon as i spot somethin'
and when you fall
i know damn well i done shot somethin'
and i'm cleaning your brains
off my windshield for frontin'
d 12 is
your local weed sellers
throwing pipe bombs in your church
to kill your elders
the men on bitches like tracks
you notice these
banging clits and ovaries
till they drop the sheets
niggas'll die from these
blows we inflict
you supposed to be in some shit
cuz you the underdog bitch

chorus 


bugz'll murder you
in less than a word or two
bring the art of war to your door
call me sonny zoo
nigga don't be mad cuz your broad is a trick
always dialing 976 need a dick 
niggas like you
i'm known to smack stab and spit on
kick at hit on you hear me bitch it's still on
calling through my crib
like your bout it with your shouts
ain't you the same nigga
who was crying on his couch
apologize on site boy
if you like your life boy

and take his bleel
or bought a royal mope
and destroy him with my steal

take your bitch on jenny jones
then beat your ass on jerry springer

or get your head split and mouth bruised

with the tip of my bone
get in your girl and keep fucking
until she starts screaming "leave me alone"
walking predacone
looking for weak grade to set it on
from dusk til dawn i bomb
went through hell and remain calm
the devils to stir us to fight me
just to see what type of shit that i was on
those bastards is why they got burnt
and turned into crisp xxxxx

and people think and praise with words that i like
with things that i say on you

put you in the back of my trunk
get in my car trick
running with nothing but thugs

getting at you whether you coming out
or you been out

playing the game of death
take your last breath
til your last name is left

chorus
aiyyo   my style bust holes in the earth crush the crust

 nah man let the morgue pick 'em


cancel the hash shit i'm fillin my glands full of acid
two hands full of ass dancin with angela bassett
make plans for the casket your head lands in a basket
a dead man's in the plastic i got red hands and the mask fits

get every nerve hurt   spot a mic and walk toward it
my whole click'll beat yo' fuckin ass and camcord it


somebody hide me too many hoes on my dick
smoked all your "hay" who wants to start the crucial conflict
i'm the big daddy smokin blunts in cali
ill enough to do a driveby on a stay in school rally
stop stop knockin cause ain't nobody there
hoes with aids   i still fuck bare
cause i i just don't care
ill enough to fuck up all yo' dental care
when bizarre kid comes through you better yell mayday
while you was havin "good times" i dyno mite kujo and jj

and read my kids horror stories when i lay 'em to bed
ridin bikes butt naked gettin frisked by policemen

gettin high off mushrooms and play "a friendly game of dodgeball"

bitch yeah  aiyyo


you're battlin the dirty dozen that don't pay

"bust it rugged shine like a gold nugget" 
"when i bust on the mic i bust a real hard rhyme"    > keith murray
"every time i pick up the microphone i drug it 
"when i bust on the mic i bust a real hard rhyme"    > keith murray


i'm rockin shit packin shit while stackin shit
if anyone steps up askin shit i'm blastin shit
you gone phase me but swingin like peter parker
motherfuck the shop i'll wreck the goddamn barber
forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
you couldn't be a dope mc if you said his rhymes drugged up
i told you once but you forget so here's a flashback
"you couldn't be shit if you came out my asscrack"
stop frontin kid you know you ain't paid
and the only mic/mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
so cut the shit cause its startin to draw flies
you're played like my five year old's newborn toys
don't know shit about chicago but i could still make illa noyz
like robin leech i display stylish ways
thats rough like my face when i haven't shaved in days
listen up all these words take heed
when i cock and squeeze no more mc's breathe 
i'm sick of this here's my final diss
fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like piss

   2x


my smith and wessy got you layin in some alley messy
got your family lookin for your ass on sally jesse
we squash beef in the mo' when you ain't breathin no more
leavin your skull split like steven seagal
let the cat out flat out detroit's a mad house
so i don't get offended when i hear my city badmouthed
we quick to pull the gat out and set it
and leave you with more shit missin than a lil' kim radio edit
stick up kids be tryin to live paid
you get your grill sprayed with twenty seven bullets in your ribcage
get the guage cock it back empty your pockets jack
or i'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack
murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
break into your crib still your shit and lock it back
ten year old kids be standin on the block with gats
just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
where i'm fromyaknow what'm sayin that's some old detroit shit
y'all wouldn't know about that shit though less you come
to my city ya know what'm sayin see where we live 
cause we shine

   2x


mc's put detroit up in they rap songs
cause without us there careers wouldn't last long
so like a generation we've been passed on
now its our time to shine put your glasses on
got these a & r's and labels with binoculars
lookin in jockin us and not jockin yours
too many groups follow trends unoriginal
usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
one million rappers in this bitch they need to slow down
evualute the situation all the rest are killers
fly hoes out on jefferson with the drug dealers
two years in the joint nobody's touchin hush
try to say you'll put us down but your under us
now who the fuck are you its just coincidental
when your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
your just a phone tapper with no backbone
talkin shit i got a clique that only pack chrome
have your ass gone nowhere to run when we hit
next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit

   3 and 1/4x
"hey look let me tell y'all somethin aight
 what i do i do straight like that
 so ain't no sense in y'all even troublin y'all selves over that
 cause man the way i feel right now today"


i came up on the wrong side of the fence
i gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
but hell in my defense
and i got too much way too fast momma told me it won't last
now i'm back down on the bottom wishin that i took another path
i should've listened but my mind was gone
my temper too quick so when my fuse get lit yo when it's on it's on
yeah e'rybody wrong yeah and i'm always right
yeah ain't nobody to blame now it's me vs me man this my fight


so don't look at me
like i am the same person i was before fore fore
now we all deserve a second chance
and this time i think i can do more more more
or better


yeah i put that on my family
all you gotta do is give me the chance 
and i can show you that i'm worthy of the trust that you require
put it all on my shoulders i'm a fighter i won't get tired
when i'm back up in this corner
back up in this corner tryna get out
back up in this corner
back up in this corner gotta get out


you think i got none but i got all kind of sense
stop judgin my book by the cover maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
and i ain't tryna vent
this ain't woe is me it's nothin owed to me
keep the swan song i don't need an ode to me
shit hopefully holdin this rosary
will keep me out of close calls with the old police
i said i'm tryna be a whole new me i ain't tryna do the same old thing
i'm tryna prove to my family that i will not bring
no more trouble around i ain't gotta do nothing but stay out of shit
i ain't gotta be up in the chaotic it's
probably cause it's my redemption that i'm entrenched in
and i won't let anybody deny my vision it's my decision
but y'all ain't listenin 






it's my gameplan now
is to get in this ring and show that i'm a changed man and how
i won't blow another chance to make you proud
even though you got the right to hate me now
i know you lost your hope in me but hopefully
i can restore that back where it's supposed to be
i just want my daughter back this fight mean much more than that
i'm tryna think before i react
i ain't get the message at first i tried to ignore the facts
but i'm much older she's my soldier i told ya i'd go to war for that
i said the boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
all he need is his family with him
y'all want him 'til it's no room given
i'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him


yo ay yo turn the heads and the mics up
we got the dreadknaughts you know what i'm sayin
super mc you know what i mean
bugz dirty and all that all that shit
you know what i'm sayin desperados with the cars eminem


chauvinist pig droven this big lincoln
till it went over the bridge
jumped out and dove in the ditch
broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and fridge
kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
i'm going for your mids
here's a body blow for your ribs
while you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
i know where you live your girl showed me your crib
unless she told me a fib
then i'm gonna have both y'all get did
burning incense facing a murder sentence
under intent for investigation for killing infants
while i sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jammed in their wounds
slit your carpet and rugs and fucked your apartment up
sticking up all the drugs and jumping in garbage trucks
i'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch
see me every summer layin up against the dumpster
with a one hundred dollar jumper smothered in southern comfort
got my slim shady sticker on your mother's bumper
she came home screamin a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her


ay yo
pursue to list em there's no need to diss em
they be beheavin make sure your whole breathing system
twist them like big caps who wants to hear that
rap murder rates and i snap vertebrates 
collapse further states my tribe reserves the grave
your pack deserve a crate in fact the word is fake
i'll cook you slow like egg sufficient nuts
i'm holding vandanna like seven great molested sluts
calling me a bitch nigga you need to stop
reality one on one how many times you got dropped
i'm cut throat when any track runs i smack none's
it's the rough method that makes muslims run and pack guns
i'm volcanic the sermon preacher
burning mc's most wanted by herman kefa
you tried to get a squad they was like oh no
leavin you brain dead hittin trees with sonny bono
i kick without a dojo d 12 slow flow
shoot down your mother ship and pimp slap mojo
no pro wanna go knuckle blades with renegade
nigga tried to go pop and plus they minute made
my lieutenant spray your brigade and trampled your flow
big p the reason mc's canceled their shows
the truth will hurt see proof will work your shame in it
the best part of your show is when you put my name in it
my squad godly fearin shit hardly
so i hope when i die i dope like chris farley
fuck that


who run shit watch these drums hit
you dove head first into some old dumb shit
here's a can of ass whip for you to come get
your clique made their trip i made them hoes submit
ask your girl she knows the scoop don't fuck with bugz bitch
i'll chop off her titti have you sucking one tit
them pink belly niggas is who you run with
making half ass songs shitty snares and one kick
i hate your damn sound don't like it one bit

your entire outfit is on some bullshit
and there's not a damn one that i can't out wit 
i admit that my style is unfit
for mamma's baby boy because i'm on some dumb shit
like i commit arsony get harm quick
you pull the alarm switch i'll stab you in your armpit
now who the nitwit wanna come get with
this egotistic hip hop fundal mentalisitic
don't risk it you'll get your shit split
now keep your distance and keep existence
i'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit
i smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence
i'm relentless to deny you're senseless
yo bitch pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went
fuck that


i killed competition with no way out as an opposition
execute the passengers on the flight my executive decision
then reminisce on how shady the business 
terrorists asked by israelis when they visit
bombed in insentient
one word in three in the making murdered the exhibition team finish
beat the ref senseless
no timeout extended play papers over your intermission
and increasing the battlefield with the blood of christians
cryin for the messiah but he don't listen
i pop my wing when i top the stove frame boil sizzling
i fight a maniac cook i do damage to kitchens
fuck home depot i demolition
when i home improve i'll be there to fix it
for my school is supervision for down finical aid smoked up my intuition
only hang out with rappers with explicit lyrics
and pistol grip punks with a beef bitch do you wanna get eaten


i got a mind full of troubles 
everything is in doubles
i buy my guns in couples
no time to replace fumbles
cause mc's come and mc's go we both flow
injured from head to toe
no fit a model we full throttle
you stuck in low incapable to master flow
everything is tactical living mathematical
watch master flow unleash and let go
i shit like lava original designer married to marijuana since a minor
making it a chance to see my battleship could get you wet like fibs what
applying death defying feets maintain to keep my peace
flow like to see when i release these beats over concrete


my president transitions has taken place
as eyes spread folk ally on the m i cr o
power he's cyphin not quality i deal it
lays the track and made it real i know my people feel it    
keep their head bobbin and the emotional sobbin
plus a cultural cipher after show hoes be slobbin
knobs love the fuckin flavor of the icing
plus i'm precision my double edge will continue slicin
i'll shit on you    da da da da da da

yo
at birth i was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
the first time i went to stick it up the shit hurt
mom wouldn't take me the bitch still hates me
one day she said "go rake leaves" i said "make me"
i'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid
who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
arguing with me and mom was on going
she called law enforcement when i broke the law mower
the slut gave me a truck when i turned sixteen
i went to start it and it screamed "please fix me"
back then when will smith was still the fresh prince
and him and jeff were still best friends i guess then
i decided to cut class to rap full time
and get the fuck outta this fake shit school and rhyme
anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
come and see me see if i don't live up to this image
break shit

 :
"noyou hear me you go to hell"


yo y'all rappers have never learned
that's why i'm fuckin wit y'all
run around telling niggas they can fuck wit parl
i bring it to your high school smoke the prom
put your brother in a headlock choke your mom
cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven 
walk around ripping on niggas madder than james evans
my left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
slap my dick like kool keith
fuck like you stole from me and rules the streets
i don't wanna have to fuck you up so cool cease
parl yams be the chosen thug
what i spit be cold juice like a frozen hug
run the streets while you're stuck at home
my temper like bushwick bill bitch leave me the fuck alone
i've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
these cats just started to rhyme my pen's spillin'
your moms just told me to act i've been wheelin'
so boy just slow your deck i've been stealin'
i wet rappers cause it's me and em
i guess i just ain't give a fuck like eminem
burglarize take busts with the slugs
come in your window like  and bustin' your club
put the heat up i teach them niggaz what to suck
and my young lords when to stand up and light the dutch

 :
"noyou hear me you go to hell"


i came to my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso
drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
cause i don't give a fuck you better understand that
two zantacs i don't give a fuck where soundscan at
billboard drugs is what i kill for
i'm happy gilmore just slip me anything in pill form
i may mingle but i plan to stay single
play bingo and drink get old and watch my face wrinkle
sike i'm 24 thursday; six more birthdays 
and i'm blowin my brains out when i'm thirty
as long as my heart beats i'ma keep tryin to see
how much speed i can eat before i fall the fuck asleep
so "i'm the rapper he's the dj"
i'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin "f/u/c/k"
so jeff give me a scratch 
the rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants

 :
"noyou hear me you go to hell"
i hit harder than foreman
landing both both gloves to a low blow
with no cup
leave you speech less like when arrested development broke up
carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
crack skulls through helmets
with the penetration of a screw nailed in
return like i was sending self addressed postage
throw bricks the size of the stonehenge
before battles we pour blood
and toast death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress' doorsteps
slaughter lamb
and boar's head
every mc's cause of boredness
and mind bondage
bronchitis lung failure
language unfam i liar
art through a flooded air brush
 leave craft
sentences joined with words holding hands
it's a tight squeeze
from where your head will be landing
in exact time flight leaves

<watch this>
<watch this>

<watch this>
<don't watch that watch this>


who's arm is this
i must have cut it off of the pharmacist
who refused to renew my seventh presciption of darvecet
i'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
and never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
i hate my life
that's why i degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
and just ate the knife
my mother's screaming 'please heal him take him straight to christ'
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice pistol whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
i was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head
i'm wishin' i was dead
while i'm crawlin out of my bed
found it red and my rash is returning
i feel the sensation of burning
occurring usually during pain for release in my urine
screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
these pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
the devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

<watch this>
<watch this>

<watch this>
<don't watch that watch this>
i ain't gonna eat i ain't gonna sleep

there ain't gonna be no reasonin speakin wit me
you speak on my seed then me no speak a ingles
so we gonna beef and keep on beefin unless
you're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
and settle this face to face and you're gonna see
a demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
and you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself

depicts fiction in his verse
and as i breathe and you be deceased

fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis




aw yeah 
doc doc you gotta give us some good news



don't let me find out the bitch in you
don't let me find out the snitch in you


fame and fortune it's not your forte
fuck the world now i'm done with foreplay
doctor's orders go fuck yourself
take two of these in the morning overdose and kill yourself


doctor's orders


listen this is my evaluation
this shit over saturated y'all can get evacuated
kids sippin actavis and they ain't even activated
married to the internet stuck in place salivatin
ain't nobody graduatin
don't nobody love this shit the way i love it it's why i gotta hate it
everybody out for fame that ain't no exaggeration
damn i'm gettin aggravated fuck i'm gettin agitated
teachers so underpaid in these fuckin schools
the police got our name in all they databases
girls be 13 actin 22
niggaz be 44 actin half they ages
somebody tell me what the fuck is goin on
these niggaz in tight shit i'm in the fuckin matrix
it's lookin like a sign of the revelation
'bout time of the return of the fuckin greatest
i got all these patients man how come they ain't patient with me
they just think i want the money why when i can take it with me
y'all don't do it for the love for the love not
they gon' find out who you are just admit it 'fore you get admitted


yeah say what you livin about
fuck you gon' tell me
do you remember where you started out though
you lookin lost now 
fake it 'til you make it take your little paper book
when you look in the mirror your credibility's gone now
i'd rather be hated on for who i am
than to be loved for who i'm not that's word to doc



  
in the beginning a few of the people who had a problem i was this good scoffed
i just shook off
probably reminded you of the first time you saw tiger woods golf
never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
but based on how i ascended see how plain/plane it was now they want me to jet
no one really gave a fuck about my descent 'til i took off
mistook me because i look soft
but i stood tall i just follow the 
so i rose and grew balls told these hoes to screw off
decided opposin you is what i'm 'posed to do alls
i did was say what i'm feelin when the vocal booth calls
and had you on pins and needles when i spoke to you all
you felt my pain it's almost like i poked voodoo dolls
and i hope my spirit haunts the studios when i'm gone
my picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
and fuckin goes through the walls like the ghost of lou rawls
karma's headed for armageddon the drama setter
i'm goin in already got an arm and head in
whoever said words are just words can't hurt me more than i give
fuck if my image even ends up takin a personal hit
whoever i hurt or whatever bridges i burned in this bitch
and whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
and whatever consequences come with every verse it's worth it
so doc turn the beat on whose turn is it to get murdered on it
and here's to all the years i spent toein a line to overtime
as sure as a mole is blind in my mind
i'm still underground as a groundhog and i'ma gopher/go for mine
like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
no sign of slowin these lines are my nines
i just load up the most rhymes  and open fire with a closed mind
all i needed was someone to co sign
been a  assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole time
day one say when to blast just give me the order i spray uh 
pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint gun
ain't no one safe from non believers there ain't none
i even make the bitches i rape cum
i'm waitin on someone to say somethin
dre make the bass pump and let the tape run
for old time's sake i'll spit it straight through this is take one
the moment you're waitin for has come
but the




doctor's orders
doctor's orders

i'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long i'm runnin out of time
i need a doctor call me a doctor
i need a doctor doctor to bring me back to liiiiiiife


i told the world one day i would pay it back
say it on tape and lay it record it so that one day i could play it back
but i don't even know if i believe it when i'm sayin that
doubt's startin to creep in every day is just so gray and black
hope i just need a ray of that
cause no one sees my vision when i play it for 'em they just say it's wack
but they don't know what dope is
and i don't know if i was awake or asleep when i wrote this
all i know is you came to me when i was at my lowest
you picked me up breathed new life in me i owe my life to you
but for the life of me i don't see why you don't see like i do
but it just dawned on me you lost a son demons fightin you
it's dark let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
i don't think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
cause me and you were like a crew i was like your sidekick you
gon' either wanna fight when i get off this fuckin mic or you
gon' hug me but i'm out of options there's nothin else i can do
cause




it hurts when i see you struggle you come to me with ideas
you say they're just pieces so i'm puzzled cause the shit i hear
is crazy but you're either gettin lazy or you don't believe in you no more
seems like your own opinion's not one you can form
can't make a decision you keep questionin yourself
second guessin and it's almost like you're beggin for my help
like i'm your leader you're supposed to fuckin be my mentor
i can endure no more; i demand you remember who you are
it was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin you
don't sign me everyone at the fuckin label let's tell the truth
you risked your career for me i know it as well as you
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy dre i'm cryin in this booth
you saved my life now maybe it's my turn to save yours
but i could never repay you what you did for me is way more
but i ain't givin up faith and you ain't givin up on me get up dre
i'm dyin i need you come back for fuck's sake
cause




bring me back to liiiiiiiiife 
i need a doctor doctor to bring me back to liiiiiiife


it literally feels like a lifetime ago
but i still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
you walked in yellow jumpsuit whole room cracked jokes
once you got inside the booth told you like smoke
went through friends some of 'em i put on but they just left
they said they was ridin to the death   but where the fuck are they now
now that i need them i don't see none of 'em all i see is slim
fuck all you fair weather friends all i need is him
fuckin backstabbers when the chips were down you just laughed at us
now you 'bout to feel the fuckin wrath of aftermath faggots
you gon' see us in our lab jackets
and ask where the fuck we been you can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots
and the cracker's ass little cracker jack
beat makin wack ass backwards producers i'm back bastards
one more cd and then i'm packin up my bags
and as i'm leavin i guarantee they'll scream "dre don't leave us like that man"
cause


y'all know me still the same og but i been low key
hated on by most these niggaz with no cheese no deals and no gs
no wheels and no keys no boats no snowmobiles and no skis
mad at me cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
to add to the wall full of plaques
hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
did y'all think i'ma let my dough freeze
whore please   you better bow down on both knees
who you think taught you to smoke trees
who you think brought you the oldies
eazy e's ice cube's and doc's then snoop d o double g's
and the group that said mother "fuck tha police"
gave you a tape full of dope beats
to bump when you stroll through in your hood
and when your album sales wasn't doing too good
who's the doctor they told you to go see
y'all better listen up closely
all you niggaz that said that i turned pop or the firm flopped
y'all are the reason that dre ain't been getting no sleep
so fuck y'all all of y'all; if y'all don't like me   blow me
y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me


nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
but nothing comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish
and motherfuckers act like they forgot about dre


so what do you say to somebody you hate 
or anyone trying to bring trouble your way
wanna resolve things in a bloodier way 
then just study your tape of nwa
one day i was walking by with a walkman on
when i caught a guy gave me an awkward eye 
and strangled him off in the parking lot with his karl kanis©


 well uhh i know you
 aiy fuck you you stupid bitch
 this is shame on you this is
 just shut the fuck up
 what you're doing to my lawn that's a shame of you
 fucking bitch shut up
 i say stop do that to my house and i ain't embarrass from you
now you and him and your hoodlums you're ruining my sleep
and my baby pie is awaken up because you woke him up
you do it always with him you're miserable guys


we are just in front of the house where a fire broke out
in an upscale neighborhood as you can see this lady here 

and this gentleman here he claims that he has seen all happen
can you tell me your name sir


yeah all i now is i'm upstairs and i'm listening to my will smith cd
and i have seen all these flames going everywhere you know what i'm saying
hey hold on a minute bitch   yo aiy hold on a minute
yo detroit what   detroit what   detroit baby


okay thank you sir reporting live on this channel eight
i'm jane yamamoto back to the studio


and when the cops came through me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
and still weren't found out 
from here on out it's the chronic two
starting today and tomorrow's the new
and i'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a charleston chew

slim shady   hotter then a set of twin babies
in a mercedes benz with the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid 80s
calling men ladies; sorry doc but i been crazy
there's no way that you can save me
it's okay go with him hailey 




if it was up to me you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
wit your hands out looking up to me like you want something free
when my last cd was out you wasn't bumping me
but now that i got this little company
everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
but you won't get a crumb from me
cause i'm from the streets of 
i told them all   all them little gangsters
who you think helped mold them all
now you wanna run around talking bout guns like i ain't got none
what you think i sold them all   cause i stay well off
now all i get is hate mail all day saying dre fell off
what cause i been in the lab with a pen and a pad
trying to get this damn label off
i ain't having that; this is the millennium of aftermath
it ain't gon' be nothing after that
so give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
you can have it back so where's all the mad rappers at
it's like a jungle in this habitat
but all you savage cats know that i was strapped with gats
when you were cuddling a cabbage patch



 who's next


coming and stomping it's hitt from bronson
in collaboration with dre from compton
uhh i came to say a little something 
what  hittman at the service
highly intensive tongue talents making all nervous
y'all faking a four nine with my rhymes on purpose

dear slim i wrote but you still ain't callin
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not a got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways; eff it what's been up  man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her  i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some  who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground stuff that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the stuff you did with rawkus too that sh was fat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan
this is stan


my tea's gone cold i'm wondering why
i got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
oh i can't see at all
and even if i could it would all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
not so bad


dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad   i just think it's messed up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
for four hours and you just said "no"
that's pretty crummy man   you're like his favorite idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein lied to
remember when we met in denver   you said if i'd write you
you would write back   see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin in your songs
so when i have a crummy day i drift away and put 'em on
cause i don't really got  else so that  helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stan    ps    we should be together too




dear mister i'm too good to call or write my fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word   i don't deserve it
i know you got my last two letters;
i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doin 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drownin
now it's too late   i'm on a 1000 downers now i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you slim we coulda been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you go to sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slim;  shut up   i'm tryin to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shoot i forgot how'm i supposed to send this tape out
  
   




dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i musta missed you
don't think i did that sh intentionally just to diss you
but what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that stuff just clownin dawg c'mon   how messed up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counselin
to help your ass from bouncin off the walls when you get down some
and what's this junk about us meant to be together
that type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad  try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy bit
i seen this one  on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove this car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about his name was it was you
damn


have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
but what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
and everything you stand for turns on you despite you
what happens when you become the main source of a pain
"daddy look what i made" dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy where's mommy i can't find mommy where is she"
i don't know go play hailie baby your daddy's busy
daddy's writing this song this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady yeah baby slim shady's crazy
shady made me but tonight shady's rocka by baby


and when i'm gone just carry on don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back
and when i'm gone just carry on don't mourn
rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
just know that i'm looking down on you smiling
and i didn't feel a thing so baby don't feel no pain
just smile back


i keep having this dream i'm pushin' hailie on the swing
she keeps screaming she don't want me to sing
"you're making mommy cry why why is mommy crying"
baby daddy ain't leaving no more "daddy you're lying
"you always say that you always say this is the last time
"but you ain't leaving no more daddy you're mine"
she's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"daddy please daddy don't leave daddy   no stop it"
goes in her pocket pulls out a tiny necklace locket
it's got a picture "this'll keep you safe daddy take it withcha'"
i look up it's just me standing in the mirror
these stinkin' walls must be talking cause man i can hear 'em
they're saying "you've got one more chance to do right"   and it's tonight
now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
and just as i go to walk out of my bedroom door
it's turns to a stage they're gone and this spotlight is on
and i'm singing




sixty thousand people all jumping out their seat
the curtain closes they're throwing roses at my feet
i take a bow and thank you all for coming out
they're screaming so loud i take one last look at the crowd
i glance down i don't believe what i'm seeing
"daddy it's me help mommy her wrists are bleeding"
but baby we're in sweden how did you get to sweden
"i followed you daddy you told me that you weren't leavin'
"you lied to me dad and now you make mommy sad
"and i bought you this coin it says 'number one dad'
"that's all i wanted i just want to give you this coin"
"i get the point   fine me and mommy are gone"
but baby wait "it's too late dad you made the choice
"now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
that's what they want they want you marshall they keep screamin' your name
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep just take another pill
yeah i bet you you will you rap about it yeah word k keep it real
i hear applause all this time i couldn't see
how could it be that the curtain is closing on me
i turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
put it to my brain and scream "die shady" and pump it
the sky darkens my life flashes the plane that i was
supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
that's when i wake up alarm clock's ringin' there's birds singin'
it's spring and hailie's outside swinging i walk up to kim and kiss her
tell her i miss her hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
almost as if to say



*curtains closing*
look if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip  yo


his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti
he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drops bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words won't come out
he's chokin how everybody's jokin now
the clock's run out time's up over   blaow
snap back to reality ohh   there goes gravity
ohh   there goes rabbit he choked
he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy nope he won't have it
he knows his whole back's to these ropes
it don't matter he's dope
he knows that but he's broke
he's so sad that he knows 
when he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's
back to the lab again yo this whole rap shit
he better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


you better   lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime
you better   lose yourself in the music the moment
you own it you better never let it go 
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime
you better


soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking
make me king as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post mortem it only grows harder
homie grows hotter he blows it's all over
these hoes is all on him coast to coast shows
he's known as the globetrotter
lonely roads god only knows
he's grown farther from home he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose dove and sold nada and so the soap opera
is told it unfolds i suppose it's old partner
but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da dah




no more games i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine to
five and i can't provide the right type of
life for my family cause man these god damn
food stamps don't buy diapers and there's no movie
there's no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin even harder
tryin to feed and water my seed plus teeter totter
caught up between bein a father and a primadonna
baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point i'm like a snail i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin option failure's not
mom i love you but this trailer's got to go
i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go it's my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

 the fuck is wrong witchu
 ha
you are just jealous of me cause you you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
cause you're a meanie a meanie
but it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
cause i'm what you want to be so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie big weenie


alright listen i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
i'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind   your eyes close 'em
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore
into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
now why did they make yoo hoo  hippity ga ga boo boo
psych i'm kidding i just wanted to see if you're still listening
okay now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question   why do i always sense this
undeniable tension from the moment that i enter into the room
it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever there's conversation why am i always mentioned
i've been dying to ask it's been itchin at me is it just because




alright now i i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was   i fucked up
psych i'm kidding again you idiot no i didn't
that's just what you wanted to hear from me is that i fucked up ain't it
but i can bust one take without lookin at no paper 
it doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth okay  you're drooling you have tooth decay
your mouth is open you're disgusting what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what you munch a bunch of crunch 'n munch
your tooth is rotten to the gum tour breath stinks wanna chew some gum
yes i do sir what am i on  you sir are on truth serum
marshall i'm so jealous of you please say you won't tell nobody
i'd be so embarrassed i'm just absolutely terrified
that someone's gonna find out why i'm saying all these terrible
evil and awful mean things it's my own insecurity




alright now we we're going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
cause that's exactly what your eyes look like want to check to see
here's a mirror notice the resemblence here
wait let me put these sunglasses on now look in this mirror
how about now  what do you have in common
you're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you i know you're not happy
i know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
somewhere crying curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
there is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why you even doing this to yourself it's pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is tortureous
my point is this   that if you say mean things your weenie will shrink
now i forgot what the chorus is you're just a




get the fuck off my dick 
tell myself that i was doing alright
there's nothing left to do tonight
but go crazy on you crazy on you
let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuuu ohhhhhh


can't you see what you do to me baby
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a lunatic you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy
i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i want to slit your throat the next i wanted sex
you make me crazy the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
cause the next day we're right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us
we can't figure out if it's lust
or it's love which that is attractin us to each other
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just cause i came home late last night crawled in bed and i woke you
but if there's one thing about you that i admire it's baby
because you stay with me maybe because you're as crazy as i am
cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
like a devil in disguise you're always full of surprises
always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos
you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
you're only 24 but you're plenty more ma ture
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool chillin
you play your position you never step out of line
even though i stay in your business you've always kept out of mine
i wonder what's on your mind sometimes they say love is blind
maybe that's why the first time i dotted your eye you ain't see the sign




or maybe you did maybe you like me and stuff
maybe cause we're crazy in loooove


you are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
the moral the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being the meaning of my existence
if it wasn't for you i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do and the irony is you rely on me
as much as i rely on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire
you're my entire supply   gas the match and igniter
the only way that i am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always gonna make you feel i don't need you as much
as i really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
but you're essential to me you're the air i breathe i believe
if you ever leave me i'd probably have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem the elaina to my hailie
you are the words that i'm lookin for when i'm tryin to describe
how i feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
you're like the pillar that props me up the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half the wife who never divorced me
you're like the root to my evil you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me




and no matter how much too much is never enough
maybe cause we're crazy in loooove
'ey yo paul
it's em
i got your call about the michael jackson thing
and i know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
what does he "wanna be startin' somethin"
er wow
well i'll show him who's really "bad" 
paul "the way you make me feel" with these calls
you should really take a look at the "man in the mirror" 
and tell him to "beat it" because i "won't stop 'til i get enough"
do you "remember the time" we were watching the "billy jean" video
well he'll always be that michael to me
and it doesn't matter if he's "black or white"
because i "can't stop loving" him and i hate plastic surgeons
and i hope they all fucking diiiiiiie
how do you like that
and i like him i like him a lot
i want to touch him but i can't

excuse me i'm taking a shit
sorry
anyways call me back
i have this idea about how i want to end the show
so hit me when you get this message fucker
oh and by the way

i go out and just come back full circle again
you a fad that means you somethin that we already had
but once you're gone you don't come back


too bad you're off the map now radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin whinin and bitchin
sit and observe listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i send multi platinum albums later three diamond
worldwide we on the charts with a bullet and still climbin



 when dr dre says crunk you will get it crunk
 get it crunk 
 and when 50 cent says jump you get on one foot and
 jump 


the buzz is tremendous we drop you artists censored
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches


we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular contentions


but critics say that doc is soft doc is talk doc is all
washed up knock it off who the fuck is doc impressin
doctor's this doctor's that you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc cause doc left you all guessin
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record  what
we gon' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second 
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass


cause we done swam with the sharks wrestled with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
graced the cover of rolling stone pages broke down barriers
of language and races just call on the caped crusaders
and leave it to me and dre to pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to



 50 cent c'mon


bounce now hands up you know how we do
we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret everybody know
when dre's involved there's plenty money involved


and plenty honies involved the sunny sundays and palm trees
cali every day is just another party from the valleys
all the way to them 8 mile alleys let's rally


hands up for the grand finale
now raise up out your seat dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week


you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker

  bye bye


lord please forgive me for what i do
for i know not what i've done


father please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


momma had a baby and it's head popped off 
my momma don't want me the next thing i know i'm gettin dropped off

ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch

but they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
 'til somebody finally took me in
my great aunt and uncle edna 'n charles 
they were the ones who were left in charge
my elementary they gang up on me and sang this song

it went a little somethin like
mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb
debbie had a satan spawn satan spawn
momma why do they keep saying this i just don't understand understand
and by the way where's my daaaaaaaaaaad




predominantly predominantly everything's always predominantly
predominantly white predominantly black but what about me
where does that leave me  well i guess that i'm between predominantly
both of 'em i think if i hear that fuckin word again i'ma scream
while i'm projectile vomiting what do i look like a comedian to you
do you think that i'm kidding  what do i look like some kind of idi 
wait a minute shit don't answer that   why am i so misunderstood
why do i go through so much bullshit it sucks bullshit it's tush mull bish
woe is me there goes poor marshall again whinin about his millions 
nd his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin in
from the dad he never had and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict and his ex wife how they go at it
man i'd hate to have it as bad as that mr mathers claims he had it
i can't imagine it that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
man if i only had half of it
shit if you only knew the half of it




evil deeds while i plant these evil seeds
please release me from these demons
i never had any of this shit planned mom please believe
i don't wanna be satan's spawn never got the chance to say i'm sorry
now look at all the pain i caused
dear santa claus why you not comin this year again
what did i do that was so bad to deserve this
everything could have been so perfect
but life ain't a fairytale i'm about to be hoist up in the air
forty feet below me there's people everywhere
i don't even know what it feel like they know me cause i'm in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go but life is like a merry go round
here we go now doe se doe now curtains up the show must go
now ring around the rosie the show's over you can all go home now
but the curtain just don't close for me this ain't how fame is supposed to be
where's the switch i could just turn off and on this ain't what i chose to be
so please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til i pass 50 back the baton the camera's on my soul is gone

   repeat 2x

let the top down and my hair blow
i don't know where i'm goin'
all i know is when i ger there someone's gonna 
excuse me miss i don't mean to sound like a jerk

i'm in jail and i don't know what happened
they say i was runnin' butt naked
down the street screamin' 
well i'm sorry i don't remember
all i know is this much i'm not guilty
they said "save it boy we got you on tape
yellin' at an old lady" 
now this is the part where the rap breaks down
it's real intense no one makes a sound
everything looks like it's "8 mile" now
the beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
now snap back to reality look it's b rabbit
oh you signed me up to battle i'm a grown man

girl you know you're my world
alright now lose it 
just lose it 
go crazy 
oh baby  oh baby 
step by step heart to heart
left right left we all fall down


step by step heart to heart
left right left we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win but the battle wages on
we're toy soldiers


i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never 'sposed to show it my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin toe to toe with the benzino
it don't matter i'd never drag 'em in battles that i can handle
'less i absolutely have to i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jay z and nas shit
and even though the battle is won i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip hop for it's not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i want to destroy somethin i helped build
it wasn't my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin 
and that was just out of respect for not runnin my mouth
and talkin about somethin that i knew nothin about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasn't my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv now i'm talkin a man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
i'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute because




there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin
but now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated it ain't just words no more is it
it's a different ball game you call names and you ain't just rappin
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck him 50 smash him mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
but i'm so busy bein pissed off i don't stop to think
that we just inherited 50's beef with murder inc
and he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
to show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted it's not a plea that i'm coppin
i'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin
off at your jaws well then i can cause frankly i'm sick of talkin
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause


still love me  take this 
you ready  one two three 


the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me  i just love you more
you don't want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more


it's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we don't
we do it for us it's lust cause neither one of us trust each other
so we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other out
we know what it's about shout
'til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
fistfight 'til we turn this mother out
then apologize after laughter pain
it's insane we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad but it's true when i'm layin here with you
there ain't nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause




cause i hate you do you hate me
good   cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut but i'm equal i'm a mutt we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
we can make accusations people spred rumors
but they ain't got proof if they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me cause any chick can say that she screwin me
but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
if you didn't i wouldn't be hittin yeah i would
cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so it's off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that and that's why




i can never understand it that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die it's silly
oh why must we try is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff
try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
we're lyin to ourselves that's the beauty of it geah
cause we truly love each other that's why we always fightin
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night
and it's clear it ain't gonna change it's pent up rage
we both had we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else we've both been with someone else
and someone else's problems neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearin it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoop la all the whoopty woo
what you put me through fuckin whoopty do
but i won't be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldn't do what you did last time you wouldn't screw up
this time cause this time girl i'm tellin you what
you do it again i'm fuckin you up


no matter what you say or what you do
i'ma hunt you down 'til i find you
no matter where you run i'll be right there
right behind you in your nightmares
so i brought you the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
so when you hate me you gon' hate me more
when you find out you can't escape me whore


yeah
i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey what daddy always tell you
straighten up little soldier   stiffen up that upper lip
what you cryin about  you got me


hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone but i'm tryin to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
cause you're scared i ain't there daddy's with you in your prayers
no more cryin wipe them tears daddy's here no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it we gon' do it
laney uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
we're all we got it this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
lookin puzzled in a daze i know it's confusin you
daddy's always on the move mama's always on the news
i try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growin up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us i don't see us ever bein
together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
 

now hush little baby don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise momma's gon' be alright


heh it's funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em weren't from me cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin
cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin money for you in a jar
tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein daddy on the tv
and momma didn't like it and you and laney were too young to understand it
papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin in this empty house just reminiscin
lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
wow guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
laney i'm talkin to you too daddy's still here
i like the sound of that yeah it's got a ring to it don't it
shh momma's only gone for the moment
 



and if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'ma give you the world
i'ma buy a diamond ring for you i'ma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'ma break that birdie's neck
i'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad
ha ha 
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america

and to the republic for which it stands
 people
 one nation under god indivisible
 it feels so good to be back
 with liberty and justice for all
 mosh with me now


you scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel re energize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight tthrough the mind
i exercize my right to express when i feel it's time
it's just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight and you take it as "i'ma whip someone's ass"
if you don't understand don't even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless   past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi taskin
and juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
whose has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure movin past that
mr kiss his ass crack he's a class act
rubberband man yeah he just snaps back


come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to procede carry on give me hope
give me strength come with me and i won't steer you wrong 
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel we gon' fight
we gon' charge we gon' stomp we gon' march through the swamp
we gon' mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors
c'mon


all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together let's all form and swarm just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black 
don't matter what color all that metters we're gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
if it rains let it rain yeah the wetter the better
they ain't gon' stop us they can't we're stronger now more than ever
they tell us no we say yeah they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gon' let 'em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush
until they bring our troops home c'mon just




imagine it pourin just rainin down on us
mosh pits outside the oval office someone's tryin
to tell us somethin maybe this is god just
saying we're responsible for this monster
this coward that we have empowered this is bin laden
look at his head noddin   how could we allow 
somethin like this without pumpin our fist now
this is our final hour
let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to emplify the noise
try to amplify it times it and multiply it by six teen
million people all equal at this high pitch
maybe we can reach al'qaeda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy 
strap him with an ak 47 let him go
fight his own war let him impress daddy that way
no more blood for oil we got our own battles
to fight on our own soil no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin we ain't loyal
if we don't serve our own country we're patronizin a hero
look in his eyes it's all lies
the stars and stripes have been swiped washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight you'll know why   cause i told you to fight




and as we procede to mosh through this desert storm
and these closing statements if they should argue
let us beg to differ
as we set aside our differences and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president for the present
and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr president  mr senator

 oh ah  oh oh ah ah
oh ah  oh ah

 erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
and woke up in bed next to his best friend derreck bare naked
 janean just turned 16 and used a fake id
to sneak in vip to see r kelly   he he he he he he
to be so young and naive
oh what i wouldn't give to live so kim and carefree
paris and nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
hickory dickory  look at me  wizardry
with these words   am i a jerk or just jerk chicken
or  jerkin the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle or is it a circle jerk
wait a minute what am i sayin  allow me to run it back
and rewind it  let me ask you again
am i just jerkin the chain am i beserk or insane
or am i just one of them damn amateurs workin the damn camera
filmin one of them paris hilton homemade pornos
who keeps tiltin the lens at an angle 
just recently somebody just discovered
britney and justin videotapes of them fuckin
when they were just mouseketeers in the mickey mouse club and dusted 'em
and went straight to the source with them
cause they coulda sworn someone said
nuh   and then tried to erase and record over it
but if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
uhh uhh and then they come to
find out it was justin sayin "i'm go nna cum"




any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
and address it about my lyrics i'd love to hear it
all you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
it's 1 800 i'm a dick sucker i love to suck a dick
and if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
and i'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
that i fall out with dre wake up gay and make up with ray 
so fuck a chicken lick a chicken suck a chicken beat a chicken
eat a chicken like it's a big cock ba ca ba kawk
or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick
in your mouth i'm done you can fuck off fucka fuck off




there's not much you could do or say to phase me
people think i'm a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc drezy'll
have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
if they heard some shit i layed to tape 'fore they erase me
i may be a little too fast paced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times cause i say so many rhymes it may seem
like i'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when i'm pushin up daisies and gone
as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i the heavenly gates i'd be cool beside jay z
for every single die hard fan who embrace me
i'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and i'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom far as she raised me
in a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you ain't gonna make or break me
tryin to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake g
you're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit you've been savin
to say to me you had all this time to think about it
now don't pussy out and try to about face me
cause i've been patiently waitin for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see


no matter how many battles i been in and won
no matter how many magazines on my nuts
no matter how many mc's i eat up
ohhhh it's never enough


my flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
uh oh it gets worse when i go back to the basics
you gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
the smell of victory love it so much i can taste it
i spot my target blaze it direct hit graze it
your peace talk save it your shit sounds dated
you're over rated i'm obli gated to
study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
if i'm the best and the worst then god's gift is a curse
soldier trained to destroy you payin attention boy
i spit shit slick shit so quick you miss shit
to be specific i go ballistic it's hieroglyphic
my music is a drug press play you ain't gotta sniff it
shoot it or pop it roll it bag it or chop it
it get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
when it's hot it's hot your hatin is undeniable stop it



one shot two shot three shots four shots
all i hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
bodies drop hit the floor music's off party stops
everybody hit the door somebody's lickin shots off


security's gone i'm trapped in the club
and i'm tryin to run and get my motherfuckin gun

i'm tryin to run and save my motherfuckin life
oh shit  the shooter's comin
bitches hollerin niggaz runnin

i'm tryin to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at

two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
this chick is clingin on to me sobbin and sighin
sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
but it's real and it's on and caps is gettin peeled
so i hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
 she got hit and now she's yellin 
i told her i'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
i squeezed through the back door and made my escape
i ran and got my 38 i hope it's not too late

and i'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
i'm in the mood to strut my ak ain't even tucked
i'ma meet you at the club we gon' fuck these hoes up




i never seen no shit like this in my life before
people are still camped out from the night before
sleepin outside the door waitin in line still
tryin to get inside the club to see d 12 perform
the fire marshalls know the venue's too small
people are wall to wall three thousand and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
missed who he's aimin for six feet away is the door
into st andrew's hall now the strays flyin all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face
another one of 'em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
i'm posted up at the bar havin a mazeltov
bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
thank god i'm alive i gotta find denaun
and where the fuck is von  he usually tucks one on him
wait a minute i think i just saw bizarre
nah i guess not what the fuck  oh my god it was
i never saw him run so fast in my life
look at him haulin ass i think he left his wife
there she is on the ground bein trampled
i go to grab her up by the damn hand but i can't pull her
 god damn there just went another damn bullet
i'm hit my vest is barely able to handle it
it's too thin if i get hit again i can't do it
i scoop d follow bizarre's path ran through it and
made it to the front door and collapsed
on the steps looked up and i seen swift
shootin it out but i can't see who he's shootin it out with
but denaun's right behind him squeezin his four fifth




yo it's a friday night came to this bitch right
big ass on my left hand desert eagle in my right
i ain't come in this bitch to party i came in this bitch to fight
although i can't stay here to fight cause i'm poppin niggaz tonight
that's right bitches i'm drunk with revenge
shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin to check when i get in
swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that the schmuck
that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
so one shot for the money two is to stop the show
the third's for the bartender 
i just wanna know who drivin the black mitsubishi
he tried to run so proof shot him in the knee with a three piece



em it's paul
erm listen i just got a call from the label
and you're probably not going to be suprised but erm
michael jackson was extremely upset about the "just lose it" video and erm
i mean he's pissed so
i i dunno what he's going to do but
we gotta talk about how we are going to handle this
um oh yeah anyway
somebody told me that er they heard a rumour that you got a new gun
err i know it's probably not true
but i just need to talk to you about that
so erm give me a call

there i go thinkin of you again


you don't know how sick you make me
you make me fuckin sick to my stomach
every time i think of you i puke
you must just not know oh oh oh oh oh ohh
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you i puke


i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more
more suitable for this type of song   whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i can think of
sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink ta
so fuck it i'ma start right here i'll just be briefer
bout to rattle off some of the reasons
i knew i shouldn't go and get another tattoo
of you on my arm but what do i go and do
i go and get another one now i got two ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
i'm sittin here with your name on my skin
i can't believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend now her name's gotta be kim shiii iii iii iit
if you only knew how much i hated you
for every motherfuckin thing you've ever put us through
then i wouldn't be standin here cryin over you booo ooo ooo ooo hoo




i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up   yeah
i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
a stupid piece'a   paper i'd rather let you see how
much i fuckin hate you in a freestyle
you're a fuckin cokehead slut i hope you fuckin die
i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
i hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut i hope you die die ie ie ie ie ie ie
but please don't get me wrong   i'm not bitter i'm mad
it's not that i still love you it's not cause i want you back
it's just that when i think of you it makes me wanna yak aaa aaa aaaak
but when else can i do i haven't got a clue
now i guess i just move on i have no choice but to
but every time i think of you now all i wanna do is puuu uuu uuuke






god damn
fuckin bitch
you find me offensive; i find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if i should draw out or line any fences; if so
to what extents if any should i go  cause it's getting expensive 
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive psychological nerve damage
to the brain when i go to lengths; this
far at other people's expenses
i say you're all just too god damned sensitive
it's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
let's end this shit now cause i won't stand for this
and christo pher reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too i ain't got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me i even believe i
had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader
and darth must of put a hex on him for later
i feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman i killed super man and how ironic
that i'd be the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic


cause i ain't got no legs or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became; with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil   my new name is
rain man


now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse
for your actions; either before during or after
performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
but who's to say what's fair to say
and what not to say let's ask dr dre
dr dre  i got a question if i may 
is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend 
and watch his butt butt when he tees off 
but uh i ain't done yet
in football the quarterback yells out hut hut
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i don't need to go into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a female's butt
is that gay  i just need to clear things up
'til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because




you find me offensive i find you offensive
shit this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is tellin me spider man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next
and open up a whoop ass canister
god damnit dre where's the god damned beat 
anyway anyway i don't know how else to put it
this is the only thing that i'm good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic yup yup don't worry i'm on it
i got it high five nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessica's ass and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i
grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom i 
headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
and i don't even gotta make no god damned sense
i just did a whole song and i didn't say shit




cause ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
yup rain man
definitely definitely dr dre
super dope beatmaker
two thousand two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
nine hundred and se seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
 seventy
once you call my name out things will never be the same
they shoulda never let us get our foot in this game

ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missin a screw like bishop in "juice" i could lose it
at any moment those who know me know it
so they probably told to go with the flow just so that
i don't explode and have another episode
where i let it go as far as the one with benzino did 
i'm waitin for that next beef i'm cocked locked and loaded
i'm ready to go so bad
i'm goin bananas my dick's so hard anna nicole could
use it to fuckin pole vault with
oh shit  i mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
anybody i throw flames at gets a name
it's a game cause they know that they don't spit the same
it's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame
everyday it's the same thing
people in this game try to buddy buddy us
just to get close enough to study us
everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
they all tryna get that stamp
they after that shady/aftermath money
it's like a monopoly
they probably just now finally understand "how to rob" fully
50 cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me
and dre it's like we hit the fuckin lottery
and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other in time we discovered
that we had more in common that we thought with each other
both robbed of our mothers our fathers ain't want us
what was wrong with us was it our fault
cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence it is cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica
queens i still remember the call up at chung king cause
big l had just got popped just a month before
if 50 lives he's gettin dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and uhh
operate that's when he popped up at number one
and we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
even if i'm under the gun
you ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
there'll always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
still gonna conduct motherfuckin business as usual
egos aside 'fore i bruise 'em all
swallow your pride 'fore i step on it with shoes you call
nikes earthlings how do you like these
you gotta love 'em look at the bottom of 'em they're like cleats
stompin i been rompin
since tim dog was hollerin "fuck compton"
i was whylin freestylin
back when they were still makin maxell casettes
it wasn't even rap sell us yet that tells us that
any doubts in your head that seals the shit
ricky ticky toc ticky ticky toc
still with the diggy diggy doc diggy diggy doc
and ya don't stop 
if there's any bitches in this room
then there's something i gotta say say
for all the fools who fell for the first
girl who comes their way way
i've been down that road and now i'm back
sittin on square one one
tryin to pick myself up
where i started from


i never woulda thought that i'd see you out of control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know between us we was like mates of soul
nothin could intervene us especially no hoes
you was more so the chalant type i chose to more shows
haunted you nights i suppose that's how it go
with time spent emotion grows
in the beginning friends we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited explode
and obie's grinnin then you invite that obie's cold
but bitches they gon' talk niggaz they gon' hate
we established this way befo' we became mates
so what's required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire and


"spend some time with me   savour the good times"
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line
"spend some time with me   savour the good times"


i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters
'til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started gettin moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me
and whoulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them god damned darts at me
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are
but see when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
 up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life altering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring




ha ha yeah right bitch
spend some time with my dick
in most cases   stat's attitude is "fuck a bitch"
my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
but you was diff erent thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in pub lic we sufferin because of this
shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
tryin to play slick thinkin i'ma trick off grip
i'll admit i was caught in the mix down to commit
feedin you the best of me i shoulda fed you piss
we started off closer than close but who coulda predicted to know
your triflin ways woulda stopped our growth
and the final result back in that same boat
i asked myself do i love these hoes  nope


em introduced 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50
then slid off and left her to kick it with me
i complimented her i said you have very nice lips
with my imagination i could see her suckin my dick
we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast
had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind
she got to talkin talkin like a opportunist do
why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move
said she's an inspirin actress she do videos for practice
yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit



there's an intruder in my house
he cut my phone line can't dial out
i scream for police but i doubt
they're gonna hear me when i shout


a couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
but this time when i get pulled over
there's a doberman pinscher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs'll get bit foolin with me quit foolin with me
bitch you're gonna see no pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run i'ma be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashin that flashlight on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor   kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what i'm 'posed to fight with bear palms
yeah right   they comin with bombs i'm comin with flare guns
we as americans


we as a americans us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves livin up in these streets
through worse and through better health survivin by any means 
we as americans us as a citizen
we are samaritans what do we get us in
we better check ourselves look at how shit has been
take a look where you live this is america 
and we are americans


i make beaucoup bucks wearin beaucoup vests
drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
i coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
with you know who with an 's' tatooed to my chest
but i've finessed it now i've got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fifty fifty on 50
it's funny we got a buzz spreadin quicker than makin
paper airplanes out of a twenty   fuck money
i don't rap for dead presidents; i'd rather see the president 
it's never been said but i set precedents
and the standards and they can't stand it
my name shoulda been bastard the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast for that i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap pap shit that quick snap click
but this time they got fuckin auto ma tic
ain't no one gon' test this mon clack click





i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my longjohns under my sean johns
when runnin with the long arm of the law i'm long gone
i'ma do five years no less than that no questions asked
so it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead already in the red
already got a steady infrared mapped on my head
a target on my back bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass he probably gon' send a task
i ain't gon' even ask they ain't gon' let me pack
they ain't gon' gimme my semi but i got my mac back

"what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough

"we seem to be approaching  an age of the gross" 
"we all have this idea that we should move up a little bit
 from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better"


aight c'mon let's cut the bullshit enough let's get it started
let's start addressin this issue and open it up
let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
statements that's made on this tape and this whole origin of
the music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy
the music you accuse me of tryin to destroy
let's rewind it to eighty nine when i was a boy
on the eastside of detroit crossin 8 mile into warren
in the hick territory i'd like to share a story
this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
you have well informed me and i'm well aware
that i don't belong here you've made that perfectly clear
i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from bel air shoppin center just for stoppin in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
okay there's a bright side a day that i might slide
you may call it a pass i call it haulin my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh them railroad tracks them old railroad tracks
the good old notorious so well known tracks


so let's go back follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home


i'd roam in the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
sometimes i'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 mile and van dyke or steal a god damn bike
from somebody's backyard and drop it off at the park
that was the halfway mark to me kim had to walk
back to her momma's from chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when i'm kicked out my mom's
that's about the time i first met proof with goofy
gary on the steps at osbourne handin out some flyers
we was doin some talent shows at centerline high
i told him to stop by and check us some time
he looked at me like i'm out my mind
shook his head like white boys don't know to rhyme
i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit
with compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride
somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line




my first year of ninth grade can't forget that day of school
it was cool 'til your man mc shan came through
and said that "puma's the brand cause the klan makes troops"
it was rumors but man god damn they flew
must have been true because man we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones the cool j ice lamb suede too
but we just threw them in the trash like they yesterday's news
guess who came through next x clan debuted
professor x  exist in a state of
red black and green with a key sissies
now with this bein the new trend we don't fit in
crackers is out with "cactus albums" blackness is in
african symbols and medallions represent black power
and we ain't know what it meant me and my man howard
and butter would go to the mall
with them all over our necks like we're showin 'em off
not knowin at all we was bein laughed at
"you ain't even half black; you ain't 'posed to have that
 homey let me grab that and that flava flav clock
 we gon' have to snatch that" all i remember is meetin back at
manics's basement sayin how we hate this
how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
which reminds me back in eighty nine me
and kim broke up for the first time she was tryin to two time me
and there was this black girl at our school who thought i was cool
cause i rapped so she was kinda eyein me
and oh the irony guess what her name was
ain't even gonna say it plus the same color hair as hers was
and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
the bombest god damn girl in our whole school
if i could pull it not only would i become more popular
but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired i was supposed to dump her
but she dumped me for this black guy and that's the last i
ever seen or heard or spoke to the "ol' foolish pride" girl
but i've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race
and for that i apologize  i was wrong 
cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a ho

eye kyu: now what you know about a sweet mc from the 313
none of these skills you bout to see come free

if you ever wanna be one see

eminem: man what you know about a sweet mc in the 313
none of these skills you bout to see come free
so you wanna be a sweet mc you better become me
if you ever wanna be one see

verse 1: eye kyu
yo some people say i'm whack now if that's right 
i'm the freshest whack mc that you ever heard in your lifetime
my slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
boy i'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forgot a gold digger's succubus  my souls thick with ruggedness
with the mic i'm like a dyke can't no nigga fuck with this
i got more different strokes than philip drummound
on open mic i bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming 
we elevated to new heights premeditated 
let it be that i stated they hate it now that they see that i made it
the escalated can be put to the test of greatness
snatch the heart from mc's and i ate it
so i take it that's the reason i'm hated
to represent my temperment
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mc's would not be impitant
but pimping it and acting like you could rock a show 
harder than ll's rock the bells but you is a ho 
everything that you collaborate i lacerate 
my rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate yeah i got something for your ass to hate
i blasterate and have you all running master gates
and as for face clutching and touching the flows
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
bucking these hoes i got that shit down to a science
leaving them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance 
defiance no we won't have that
you want your shit to blow up
well i'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
and blast that shit to kingdom come
then bring them some of this real hip hop 
i drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
and you all knew from meeko
that you couldn't hold your own with the strength of lou forigno
so stop that bullshit and flow
yo you need to come with the real skills and act like you know

chorus: eminem

verse 2: eminem
so what you know about a sweet mc in the 313
you don't know shit so when you see one flee
you can be run d you'll never beat the mc
i'll stop the alphabet at s and got it down to a t
i'm sure your bound to agree a sweet mc crashes the spot
i'll make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot so just in case you don't remember me
i'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
it's either them or me man kill or be killed
you will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
my facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
i'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
if he's acting soft and he cowers
he better come cleaner then jay rue jacking off when he showers
you flowers got no clout with a thing
you could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
i showered the slang simple as abc's
skip over the d's and rock the microphone with e's
dethrone mc's and i'ma max alone
relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
so facts are known writers get treated with shocks
i rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
i'm greeted with flocks of fellow follower's singers
you couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
but you can bring yours let's see what you got
but don't front and never try to be what you're not
cause you can be quick jump the candlestick burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill but you still ain't jack 

chorus: eye kyu

attention all units attention all units
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
i repeat we have an apb on a man with green hair
he's armed with a knife i repeat he's armed with a knife
proceed with caution watch your back fella's 
he could be coming at your girlfriend next


there's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
his face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
he'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
he's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
check at your girl's house he was last seen there
he's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks


i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
stay away from him he ain't no good


we got the walkie talkies to keep us all informed
suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
protectors and be sure that you stand close
watch each others backs and guard your command post
and most of all be advised that he's wise
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys




i'm on a solo mission to find him personally
to settle the score and beat then him mercifully
for what he first did to me
it's sure to be the last
following footprints with a magnifying glass
to drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
i'm mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail
i heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"give me your girlfriend or i'm gonna kill ya"




i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
sneezing at dust and swinging at the spider webs
inside the depths of his basement
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
i saw my life flash in front of my eyes
i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
none of my guys knew where i'm at i was doomed
then i remembered the flashlight in my costume




dealing with backstabber's there was one thing i learned
they're only powerful when you got your back turned
i yearned for the day that we finally met again
so i can give him a taste of his own medicine
he shed his skin then he promised to come clean
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
beating him over the head with the telephone


attention all cars attention all cars
unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
he's going back to the crazy home i repeat
he's going back to the crazy home job well done


i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
stay away from him he ain't no good
i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think you're a best friend then
why i oughta
stay away from him he ain't no good

ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin a zany actin maniac in action
a brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
my rhyming skills got you climbing hills
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
i'm sliming grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
and twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up
twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more cartoons than animation
my lamination of narration
hits the snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion there ain't no time to be staring gazing
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland
i'm infinite


you heard of hell well i was sent from it
i went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments
now i'm trying to repent from it
but when i hear the beat i'm tempted to make another attempt at it
i'm infinite




bust it i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense in your elite 
defense
i got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people
mc's are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mc's and stand a lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
my a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
that eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
with entity dementedly meant to be infinite

man i got evidence i'm never dense and i been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the m o
so i'm assuming all responsibility
cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill mc's
mic nestler slamming like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
no one is specialer my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasn't practical
i'd rather led a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact i can't see or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
so this is for my family the kid who had a cammy on my last jam
plus the man who never had a plan b

verse 1: eminem
one day i plan to be a family man happily married
i wanna grow to be so old that i have to be carried
till i'm glad to be buried 
and leave this crazy world
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
it may be early to be planning this stuff
cause i'm still struggling hard to be the man and it's tough
cause man it's been rough but still i manage enough
i've been taken advantage of damaged and scuffed
my hands have been cuffed
but i don't panic and huff frantic and puff
or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
i'm anteing up double or nothing i've been trouble enough
and i'm sick of struggling and suffering see
my destiny's to rest at ease till i'm impressed and pleased
with my progress i won't settle for less than cheese
i'm on a quest to seize all my own label to call
way before my baby is able to crawl
i'm too stable to fall the pressure motivates
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
i seen the golden gates to heaven on earth
where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf q

verse 2: eminem
i'm going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep 
praying for sleep
dreaming with a watering mouth
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
in this slaughtering house caught up in bouts
with the root of all evil
i've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
and make them do shit illegal
for these grant's and jackson's
these transactions explain a man's actions
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity 
through god and there's a wish he granted me
he showed me how to cope with the stress
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
always groping a mess of flying over the nest
to selling dope with the rest
i quit smoking cess to open my chest
life is stressful inside this cesspool 
trying to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel
my little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
he's asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
kids attract static children with automatics
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
i'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
i won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
it's cumbersome i'm trying to do well on this earth
but it's been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth

denaun: what are you doing
maxine: nothing just laying in bed
denaun: huh
maxine: nothing just laying in bed
denaun: why
maxine: i don't know thinking about something freaky to do

verse 1: eminem
i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her sadly on her reputation
you're in jepordation if you ain't got no preparation
when you step away son she got her face done
looking provocative she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice or get the urgency
to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me cause i ain't trying to hear it
while your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  

verse 2: denaun porter
sometimes i wonder what's your purpose in life that is
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit
you living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night
you say it's gonna stop but it  just slows down
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this 
mystery whatever your reason even is to be
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
when you got niggas hiding in your closet
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

verse 3: 3
i met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me
so i stepped on it and then asked my homies
and chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
big game over there and take notes while i get this number
i stepped to her first i cleared my throat and said "hey bitch
haven't i seen you before" looked at my nigga
turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
and said "oh it's like that"
she said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
she started crying and asked me to forgive her and shit
she said her name was maxine so i told her i wanted her number
she asked could i give her mine two
got to the crib and called her up
we got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could i fuck
i said "maxine check this out 
give me your address i'll be through and you'll find out"
got to the crib she let me in
she didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
i said "hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things"
what the fuck are you doing
so i went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing
as she went for my midsection
i threw her down as i tore off her shirt
pulled out my jimmy and i thought about putting in work
before i hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that i gotta tell your ass"
i said "what is it another nigga  it's ok"
she said "no i forgot to tell you that i got aids"
i got up out

denaun: hey maxine
maxine: what

maxine: yeah for a small price
denaun: for a small price what you mean

the way you acting slice when i tear your back with knifes
jacking life's of mc's now i'm set to launch a plan
for blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
a stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you better set the mic down i'm steaming like a teapot
i'll make the tea hot people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle then i chase them in a jason mask
it's an amazing task to battle with success
i never gave a fuck now i give a fuck less
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when he's through with his verse i'm all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you

you slithering snake gibbering fake fibbering flake
i'll twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake for fisherman sake
if this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
every dis you can take personal
we ain't friends trying to make amends
if you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
i make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
your last releases you bad diseases that's the reason
i'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
so pass it like a hot potato
i've never been less than clever and fresh
severing flesh of fools who never impressed i can confess

chorus: thyme
who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow
point him out man i wanna know
who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow
 i wanna know i wanna know
ayo who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow
point him out bitch i wanna know
who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow
 i wanna know i wanna know
whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow
point him out  i wanna know
who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow
 i wanna know i wanna know
ayo let me get that mic man
who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow
who the fuck passed you the mic who the fuck passed you the mic

typed by: i3omb1st@aolcom

women singing:
ain't no one special special like you 
i been searching but your the one i want in my life baby 

verse 1: eminem
i'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing i'm having trouble when breathing
it's even tougher when sleeping
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving you all i'm thinking of in the evening
you got my knees buckling and weakening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that i'm struggling to keep in
and interrupt when i'm speaking
i got some game that i'm preparing to run
the way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun no matter what you're wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when i'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
i see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
the seed is passing in dust
i'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me i love you 
cause i just need you to see how much i'm eager to be
your man legally wed your love's keeping me fed
this is easily said so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down cause ain't nobody like you no where to be found

chorus:
women singing:
i been searching but your the one i want in my life baby 

verse 2: denaun porter
baby it's all on you it's you i call on boo
let's set a day up so you can fall on through
we'll take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
we'll start it out with caviar don parigne
and then when it's a fact we are warm carry on
we'll take it slow see nobody will hurry things
i got the herbs the bacardi and hurricane
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
it's still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one that's rare in bed with edible underwear
you look impeccable nothing compares
i dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
now we all set to play only thing left to say is
when you step away baby but don't forget the neglicie

chorus:
women singing:
i been searching but your the one i want in my life baby 
ain't no one special special like you 
tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight


i'm givin mad love i'm snuggling hugs
druggling thugs smuggling drugs juggling jobs guzzling jugs
so here's a toast to federal checks
hetero sex unaffordable medical debts huh
we travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
to find babbling max gaffling tracks
i grapple an axe for them baffling acts
the mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
still in my yard when i sculpted the culprit
the tall shit that'l end up with his skull split
then i buried the hatchet i carry the fat shit
butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
baby all i wanna do is swallow one or two
smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
back home when the party ends
so tonight i'm dropping naughty hints
to the finest women in the audience


tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  

eminem: cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright


aiyyo biters are like tarantulas vandealous
living as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this i'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters
i think a living never meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
you couldn't see me with binoculars
i armed like an octopus
step on stage and you get socked and pushed
talking that junk like you went black guarded your back
come to battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
every minute so when i win it you never resent it
i'm forever demented come up with funk i'll never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly sent it


tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  

eminem: cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright


eminem is heading skyward
for those who thought that i would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood
i've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
i'm hazardous enough already as it is
without you adding fuel to the fire
i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
that i'm enchanting with the romantic
freaking the vocals so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like


tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight  

eminem: cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight we don't want no one feeling uptight
cause we came here to do this tonight
till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

typed by: i3omb1st@aolcom

men singing:
jealous 

girls voice:

he just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes know what i'm saying
girls don't buy him no clothes he bought that ho some clothes
he don't buy me no clothes nigga ain't got no money no vibe no dick
i mean what do i got to be jealous for
he ain't gonna make it no where he ain't got no type of time
he has no career move i mean

verse 1:
i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me for numbers trying to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
to many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings you say i'm bad at timing things
so what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch that ain't what first attracted me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me 
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see i've never been so sure and your just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check them in
look at the nervous wreck i'm in i need my second wind say what

chorus: men singing
jealous jealousy jealousy 

women's voice: 
fuck you and what you going through
fuck eminem he just mad cause i left that nigga for another man
me and eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
immature me  nigga ain't got no dick no swang in his thang
know what i'm saying  he just mad cause i'm getting it all night
jealous of me know what i'm saying  that's what i'm talking about
mother fucker just trying to get his pussy

verse 2:
i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
until the day i started following your feetprints
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense there's someone else you like 
so i confronted you and asked you who was mike
and you was like  **i need a new nigga** 
someone rich that i could follow
and you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
leaving me in sorrow brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
i was an open target you play comedian
and i became the laughing stock but now i'm on my feet again
and so we meet again your acting like an ex wife
all in my sex life i got a message from phife
he goes "you didn't want me to see you then i don't want you now"
take a towel wipe your brow quit trying to hunt me down
you run me down and now your trying to apologize
for all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house ya'll fellas sing it

chorus: men singing
jealous jealousy jealousy 
i get lifted and spin til i'm half twisted
feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick 
pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit
shrink pencil me in for my last visit
drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers 
hash whiskey and ash til i slap bitches 
ask bizzy he's been here the past six years
mash with me you'll get in imagine this

chorus 2x


i fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mother's throat
 guess who slim shady just signed to interscope
my little sister's birthday she'll remember me
for a gift i had ten of my boys take her virginity
 and bitches know me as a horny ass freak
their mother wasn't raped i ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
pissy drunk throwin up in the urinal 
that's what i said at my dad's funeral

chorus 2x


that's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still 
that's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed 
that's why we don't call it detroit we call it amityville 
you can get capped after just havin a cavity filled 
ahahahaha that's why we're crowned the murder capital still 
this ain't detroit this is motherfuckin hamburger hill 
we don't do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot
and when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too
that's the mentality here  that's the reality here 
did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here 
while i'm holdin a pistol with this many calibres here 
plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year 
cause once i snap i can't be held accountable for my actions
that's when accidents happen
when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around you and they found you
and your family in it  
got damnit he meant it when he tells you

chorus 2x

dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum tahh dum ta dah da
dum yeaaah hahahaha whooooo shit mmmmm 
  
  guess what  i ain't coming in yet
	  i'll come in a minute
  aiyyo; this is my love song it goes like this


back when mark walhberg was marky mark
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my pre diction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and every thing's spinnin you're beginnin to think women 
are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you
get in your car start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
 earth calling pilot to co pilot
look at the life on this planet sir no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
let me out of this place i'm outta place
i'm in outer space i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so

  
cause every time i go to try to leave 
somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve 
i don't wanna but i gotta stay 
these drugs really got ahold of me 
cause every time i try to tell them "no" 
they won't let me ever let them go 
i'ma sucka all i gotta say 
is drugs really got a hold of me 


in third grade all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube
seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude
schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs
i've got no game and every face looks the same
they've got no name so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want wherever i want however i want
however i do show some respect to few
this ecstacy's got me standin next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you
we just met but i think i'm in love with you
but you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the mornin like "yo what the fuck we do"
i gotta go bitch you know i have stuff to do
cause if i get caught cheatin then i'm stuck with you
but in the long run
these drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
but fuck it i'm on one
so let's enjoy let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
til we walk around looking like some wind up dolls
shit's stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now i'm goin to try to find some more

chorus


that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably gonna want to do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend screw it
and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning
and what's a little fight tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life live it however you wanna
mari ju uana is everywhere where was you brought up
it don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
cause none of this shit is gonna mean shit where we're goin
they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin
even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin
but you're young you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
to better drugs and updated
but i still got a lot of growin up to do
i still got a whole lot of throwin up to spew
but when it's all said and done i'll be 40
before i know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of jack two grandkids in my lap
babysiting for hailey while hailey's out gettin smashed

chorus 2x

drugs really got a hold of me
they really got a hold of me
cause drugs really got ah old of me
they really got a hold of me
a lot of people ask me stupid fuckin questions
a lot of people think that what i say on records
or what i talk about on a record that i actually do in real life
or that i believe in it
or if i say that i wanna kill somebody that 
i'm actually gonna do it
or that i believe in it
well shit if you believe that
then i'll kill you
you know why
cuz i'm a

criminal
criminal
you god damn right
i'm a criminal
yeah i'm a criminal


my words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
that'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
or the homosex hermaph or a trans a vest
pants or dress   hate fags the answer's "yes"
homophobic  nah you're just heterophobic
starin at my jeans watchin my genitals bulgin 
that's my motherfuckin balls you'd better let go of em
they belong in my scrotum you'll never get hold of em
hey it's me versace
whoops somebody shot me
and i was just checkin the mail
get it  checkin the 'male'
how many records you expectin to sell
after your second lp sends you directly to jail
c'mon   relax guy i like gay men
right ken  give me an amen 
please lord this boy needs jesus
heal this child help us destroy these demons
oh and please send me a brand new car
and a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
preacher preacher fifth grade teacher
you can't reach me my mom can't neither
you can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
i watch tv and comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
you can't stop me from toppin these charts
and you can't stop me from droppin each march
with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
duhhh and to think it's just little ol' me
mr "don't give a fuck" still won't leave

chorus: eminem 

i'm a criminal
cuz every time i write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind   i guess i'm a criminal
but i don't gotta say a word i just flip em the bird
and keep goin i don't take shit from no one


my mother did drugs   tar liquor cigarettes and speed
the baby came out   disfigured ligaments indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
i'm a criminal   an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
i drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word 
my morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk
off of his own employee
now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
you can't miss me i'm white blonde haired
and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs
as long as it ain't happened to him
slim shady i'm as crazy as em
 inem and kim combined   *kch* the maniac's in
replacin the doctor cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather so i'm takin his place
 oh that's dre with an ak to his face

i told you dre you should've kept that thang put away

         hurry the fuck up  thank you


windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it
so when i rob a bank run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it
and if anybody identifies the guy in it
i'll hide for five minutes
come back shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die bitches bastards brats pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet 
if i ever gave a fuck i'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck
you motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff i say so just tape it shut 
shit half the shit i say i just make it up
to make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'ma be a fuckin rapist in a jason mask

 i'm back


i murder a rhyme one word at a time
you never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
you better get rid of that nine it ain't gonna help
what good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
i'm waitin for hell like hell shit i'm anxious as hell
manson you're safe in that cell be thankful it's jail
i used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
thirteen i was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
'til i cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
 i used to give a   fuck now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of suc cess  it sucks too much press i'm stressed
too much stares two breasts too upset
it's just too much mess i guess i must just blew up quick 
grew up quick  was raised right
whatever you say is wrong whatever i say is right
you think of my name now whenever you say "hi"
became a commodity because i'm w h i 
 t e cuz mtv was so friendly to me
can't wait 'til kim sees me
now is it worth it  look at my life how is it perfect
read my lips bitch what my mouth isn't workin
you hear this finger  oh it's upside down
here let me turn this motherfucker up right now

chorus


i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe 
 my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational 
with ken kaniff who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin to lure your kids with him into bed
it's a sick world we live in these days
"slim for pete's sakes put down christopher reeve's legs"
geez you guys are so sensitive
"slim it's a touchy subject try and just don't mention it"
mind with no sense in it fried to get so frenetic
whose eyes get so squinted i'm blind from smokin 'em
with my windows tinted with nine limos rented
doin lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hoppin out 
all high and indo scented 
and that's where i get my name from that's why they call me

chorus


i take seven  from  stand 'em all in line
add an ak 47 a revolver a nine
a mack 11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
cause  shady they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way n'sync why do they sing
am i the only one who realizes they stink
should i dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring 
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin it to christina
cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez and puffy you know this
i'm sorry puff but i don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
i still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
and just say that it ain't mine what's my name

chorus

when i just a little baby boy
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
she used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
she used to tell me he hated me
but then i got a little bit older
and i realized she was the crazy one
but there was nothin i could do or say to try to change it
cause that's just the way she was

they said i can't rap about bein broke no more
they ain't say i can't rap about coke no more
 slut you think i won't choke no whore
til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
 these motherfuckers are thinkin i'm playin
thinkin i'm sayin the shit cause i'm thinkin it just to be sayin it
 put your hands down bitch i ain't gon' shoot you
i'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
 shut up slut you're causin too much chaos
just bend over and take it like a slut okay ma
"oh now he's raping his own mother abusing a whore
snorting coke and we gave him the rolling stone cover"
you god damn right bitch and now it's too late
i'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
i invented violence you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain vicadin vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn 
texas chainsaw left his brains all
danglin from his neck while his head barely hangs on
blood guts guns cuts
knives lives wives nuns sluts

chorus: eminem

bitch i'ma kill you  you don't wanna fuck with me
girls neither   you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
bitch i'ma kill you  you ain't got the balls to beef
we ain't gon' never stop beefin i don't squash the beef
you better kill me  i'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin off at the mouth with shit i shouldn'ta said
but when they kill me   i'm bringin the world with me
bitches too  you ain't nuttin but a girl to me
 i said you don't wanna fuck with shady 
cause shady will fuckin kill you 
i said you don't wanna fuck with shady 
cause shady will fuckin kill you


bitch i'ma kill you  like a murder weapon i'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew sheets pillows and film you
buck with me i been through hell shut the hell up
i'm tryin to develop these pictures of the devil to sell 'em
i ain't "acid rap" but i rap on acid
got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
whoops  is that a subliminal hint  no
just criminal intent to sodomize women again
eminem offend  no  eminem insult
and if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
to do it again then if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th
 bitch i'ma kill you i ain't done this ain't the chorus
i ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
a bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in a tub but that's normal ain't it norman

nobody ever gave a fuck before
all they did was doubt me 
now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me 


yo you might see me joggin you might see me walkin
you might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
 or leanin out a window with a cocked shotgun
drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'pac in
lookin for big's killers dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel twelve gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off cause biggie and 'pac just missed all this
watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist' poppin and wristwatches
i had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of remi martin
startin shit like some 26 year old skinny cartman 
i'm anti backstreet and ricky martin
with instincts to kill n'sync don't get me started
these fuckin brats can't sing and britney's garbage
what's this bitch retarded  gimme back my sixteen dollars
all i see is sissies in magazines smiling
whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent
whatever happened to catchin a good ol' fashioned
passionate ass whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken
new kids on the block sucked a lot of dick
boy/girl groups make me sick
and i can't wait 'til i catch all you faggots in public
i'ma love it 
vanilla ice don't like me 
said some shit in vibe to spite me 
then went and dyed his hair just like me 
a bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin "i don't care just bite me" 
i think i was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
plus i was put here to put fear in faggots who spray faygo root beer
and call themselves "clowns" cause they look queer
faggot2dope and silent gay
claimin detroit when y'all live twenty miles away 
and i don't wrestle i'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
 ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck blaow
look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin mile road south of 10
and i don't need help from d 12 to beat up two females
in make up who may try to scratch me with lee nails
"slim anus" you damn right slim anus
i don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots

chorus two: eminem

cause i'm just marshall mathers 
i'm not a wrestler guy
i'll knock you out if you talk about me 
come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me 
and if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me 


is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me
you little groupie bitch get off me go fuck puffy
now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that i've got i've gone pop
the underground just spunned around and did a 360
now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"oh he just did some shit with missy
 so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with mc get bizzy"
my fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin
shit where the fuck you think i picked up the habit
all i had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
which is it bitch mrs briggs or ms mathers
it doesn't matter your  faggot
talkin about i fabricated my past
he's just aggravated i won't ejaculate in his ass 
so tell me what the hell is a fella to do
for every million i make another relative sues
family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
all the sudden i got 90 some cousins 
a half brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
hey hey  and then to top it off i walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap ass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page flipped right fast
and what do i see  a picture of my big white ass

dear slim i wrote but you still ain't callin
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must not a got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it what's been up  man how's your daughter
my girlfriend's pregnant too i'm bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what i'ma call her
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this everyday but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was fat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan
this is stan




dear slim you still ain't called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad   i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother man he's only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
four hours and you just said "no"
that's pretty shitty man   you're like his fuckin idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad though i just don't like bein lied to
remember when we met in denver   you said if i'd write you
you would write back   see i'm just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put 'em on
cause i don't really got shit else so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you slim no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
you gotta call me man i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours stan    ps
we should be together too




dear mister i'm too good to call or write my fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months and still no word   i don't deserve it
i know you got my last two letters;
i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sending you i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now i'm doing 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't then phil saw it all then at a a show he found him
that's kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
now it's too late   i'm on a 1000 downers now i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim we coulda been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see slim;  shut up bitch  i'm tryin to talk
hey slim that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat i just tied her up see i ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well gotta go i'm almost at the bridge now
oh shit i forgot how'm i supposed to send this shit out
  
   




dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now how far along is she
look i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother
i wrote it on the starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show i musta missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clownin dogg
c'mon   how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little i'm glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad  try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about his name was it was you
damn 
and everyone should get along
okay children quiet down quiet down
children i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr shady
children quiet down please
brian don't throw that 
mr shady will be your new substitute 
while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia 
good luck mr shady


hi there little boys and girls 
today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
but first i'd like you to meet my friend bob 
say hi bob  bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks 
and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge
'til one night mrs stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off
but bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazier than slim shady is off the vodka
you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a "dr"
he grabbed stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacey went off to wander
they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
and that's the story of bob and his marijuana 
and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want any   it's bad for you 
 
chorus: mr mackey 

see children drugs are bahhhd 
and if you don't believe me ask ya dahhhd 
and if you don't believe him ask ya mom 
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time 
so kids say no to drugs 
so you don't act like everyone else does 
then there's really nothin else to say 
drugs are just bad mmm'kay


my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it 
fuck no you ain't seen it it's the size of a peanut 
speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
if someone ever offers it to you don't do it
kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final you won't get it back
so don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your back
meet zach twenty one years old 
after hangin out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull  
his back starts tah   look like the mcdonald's arches
he's on donald's carpet layin horizontal barfin 
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
"hey adam zach is a jackass look at him"
cause they took it too so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
meanwhile zach's in a coma the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
and that's the story of zach the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels class cause it's bad for you

chorus: mr mackey 

see children drugs are bahhhd 
and if you don't believe me ask ya dahhhd 
and if you don't believe him ask ya mom 
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time 
so kids say no to drugs 
so you don't act like everyone else does 
and there's really nothin else to say 
drugs are just bad mmm'kay


and last but not least one of the most humungous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off 
bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
yum yum  then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes you see things that aren't there 
like fat woman in g strings with orange hair
  it's yarn claire
women stick 'em up their behinds go out and wear 'em 
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops did i say magic mushrooms  i meant fungus
ya tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue 
cause it comes from a cow's dung 
see drugs are bad it's a common fact
but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at 
but don't be me cause if you grow up and you go and od
they're gonna come for me and i'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause it'll be my fault
so don't do drugs and do exactly as i don't 
cause i'm bad for you

chorus: mr mackey 

see children drugs are bahhhd 
and if you don't believe me ask ya dahhhd 
and if you don't believe him ask ya mom 
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time 
so kids say no to drugs 
so you don't act like everyone else does 
and there's really nothin else to say 
drugs are just bad mmm'kay

 
come on children clap along 
sing along children 
drugs are just bad drugs are just bad 
so don't do drugs 
so there'll be more for me  


may i have your attention please
may i have your attention please
will the real slim shady please stand up
i repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
we're gonna have a problem here

y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
they first were divorce throwin her over furniture 
it's the return of the "ah wait no way you're kidding 
he didn't just say what i think he did did he"
and dr dre said nothing you idiots 
dr dre's dead he's locked in my basement 
feminist women love eminem  "slim shady i'm sick of him
look at him walkin around grabbin his you know what
flippin the you know who"  "yeah but he's so cute though"
yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose but can't
but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
"my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips"
and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they got the discovery channel don't they
"we ain't nothing but mammals" well some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes 
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
 but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote
women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes

chorus: eminem 

i'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up please stand up


will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well i do so fuck him and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy
half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
"but slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird"
why  so you guys could just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to britney spears
shit christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
you little bitch put me on blast on mtv
"yeah he's cute but i think he's married to kim hee hee"
i should download her audio on mp3 
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd 
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you 
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me

chorus


i'm like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only givin you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
i just get on the mic and spit it 
and whether you like to admit it  i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
it's funny; cause at the rate i'm goin when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
pinchin nurses asses when i'm jackin off with jergens
and i'm jerkin but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurkin
he could be workin at burger king spittin on your onion rings
 or in the parkin lot circling
screaming "i don't give a fuck" 
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time loud as you can how does it go

chorus 2x


ha ha
guess there's a slim shady in all of us
fuck it let's all stand up
whatever
dre just let it run
aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it 
just shut up and listen aiyyo

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this    on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully 
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when i'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me 
i don't know you and no 
i don't owe you a mo therfuck in thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty 
no patience is in me and if you offend me 
i'm liftin you 10 feet  in the air 
i don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you 
i don't mean to be mean but that's all i can be is just me

chorus: eminem

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
radio won't even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
i don't know it's just the way i am


sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and "oh it's his lyrical content  
  the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me 
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn  and the heroin
where were the parents at  and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upper class ci ty
havin this happenin 
then attack eminem cause i rap this way 
but i'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and i have returned

chorus


i'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is"
and pigeon holed into some pop py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
and i just do not got the patience 
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk 
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions 
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
'til i'm grabbin my hair and i'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy  i can't take it 
i'm racin i'm pacin i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for ev ery fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad

chorus  
translation

frightened with five little white vicadin pills bitin him
i'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
stingin the fuck outta everything i come across in the halls

grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
so when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds hurtin

 cause once you're hung from the drapes it's curtains

degradin creatin murders to kill haters
accused for every crime known through the equator

chorus: eminem

i never knew i knew i would get this big
i never knew i knew i'd effect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch


so who's bringin the guns in this country  
i couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in london
and last week i seen a schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
i sees three little kids up in the front row
screamin "go" with their 17 year old uncle
i'm like "guidance   ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when i asked if they liked violence"
and told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
what about the make up you allow your 12 year old daughter to wear
  so tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him fuckin him up worse

and fuck was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade flippin the gym teacher the bird 
so read up about how i used to get beat up
peed on be on free lunch and change school every 3 months
my life's like kinda what my wife's like 
fucked up after i beat her fuckin ass every night ike
so how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me

chorus


	i never knew i knew i'd
have a new house or a new car
a couple years ago i was more poorer than you are
i don't got that bad of a mouth do i
fuck shit ass bitch cunt shooby de doo wop 
skibbedy be bop a christopher reeves
sonny bono skis horses and hittin some trees 
how many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach er her him is it you is it them
"wasn't me slim shady said to do it again"
damn  how much damage can you do with a pen
man i'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been in my shoes who woulda thought
slim shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
i just said it   i ain't know if you'd do it or not

chorus


how the fuck was i supposed to know
came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role think i succeeded fulfillin
but don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speakin to children
everything was happenin so fast it was like i blinked sold three million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous cause i was gettin sick of this feelin
like i'm always under attack man i coulda stacked my shit list to the ceiling
women dishin but really
thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin shit but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what i had to say it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm livin put a dick in your rear end
that's why every time you mention a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it
cause it gave me an enormous platform i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it
mad awards had glaad annoyed atta boy
they told me to slow down i'd just zone out
good luck tryin to convince a blonde it's like tellin gwen stefani she sold out
cause i was tryin to leave no doubt
in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now
because everybody knows


everybody knows that you're just an asshole
everywhere that you go people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows so don't pretend to be nice
there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows


thanks for the support asshole
*chka* thanks for the support asshole

quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history well goddamn honkey; that compliment's like back handin a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah i'm off him but what the fuck's all this trash talking about
the fight was fixed i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down
i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt word to pacquiao
momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out or you better not come out
it's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quotin
shake speare so what if insults are revoltin
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn
vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test the testicles not that man
half of you don't got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo
my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
a black hole and i'm swallowin this track whole better pack toilet paper
but i'm takin no crap hoe here i go down the bat pole
and i'm changing back into that ol' maniac in fact there they go
tryin to dip out the back door retreating cause everybody knows




holy mackerel i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull
then screamed "icp in this bitch how do fuckin magnets work"
cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable hate to be dramatical
but i'm not romantical i'm makin up words you can understandable it's tragical
thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen that ain't practical
you crackin a joke it's laughable
cause me and love's like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say i'm un crackable
my heart is truly guarded full body armor
bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special you're retarded
thinkin you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a train wreck i got a one track mind and
shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er
cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner/minor
been tryin to hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
cause all of my spare time's spent
on my nose in this binder so don't bother tryin
only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme
and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther
so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent i'll never grow up
so to hell with your parents and motherfuck father time
it ain't never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm half dead i'm half alive
poured my half empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a motherfuckin coaster
i'm goin back to what got me here
yeah cocky and can't knock bein rudolph so fear not my dear/deer
and dry up your tear drops i'm here
white america's mirror so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself cause you're one too shouldn't be a shock
because everybody knows 

one thousand different houses and münchausen
will make you wanna punch out some fuckin one "ouch
what the fuck'd you hit me for" scream life as i punch counter
and bunches out of anger i once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
black hood with a scythe shit i laughed in his face spit
bitch gave me an extra life like "take this
now get your ass back in that game bitch
don't take shit for granted and don't take shit   give it"
only bull you should take is by the horns a mixture of whitey ford
and mighty thor i everlast pen is mightier than sword
finish writing then record replenish keep writing more
nothing's riding on it but your pride that's all you're fighting for
so you fight scratch you claw back's to wall
no one was there to catch you fall you pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off
you grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin bad you want it
pull out your badge for whoopin ass and flash it on 'em
nobody's gonna back you in the corner you're a hornet
no one's more ignorant than you fuckin four in the morning
you're at the laboratory storming like there's nothin that's more important
mc's you better consider this a formal warning you're in for it
girl what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face
i ain't finished bitch i meant in half oil the blades
nobody wants to play they say i'm a spoiled lil' baby   but


nobody puts baby in a corner
i'm only tryin to warn ya
cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
he'll fuckin flip on ya 


what goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
and big daddy kane great beats and words an erratic train
of thought like splatter paint scatter brain
yeah maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same
and you're lookin way thinner
cause your hunger got you lookin like they took away dinner  sugar ray leonard
wouldn't sugar coat a fuckin booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
when you say you're a  what  
now fling that bitch from your fingertips
hope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit
anything of wit that's interesting to spit show who's king of this fuckin english lit'
let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extending this shit
how low can you go lower then chuck d hoe
hear the bass of this in my voice rocky's back where my adrian
nobody's crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
i'm what tom brady is to the patriots
to rap not a man i'm a weapon who just happened to be a rapper
who just happened to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany in the bathroom
i'd never be the same after now i'm back with an appe 
 tite for destruction and a fuckin recipe for disaster
so let's eat cause i'm famished every deed is a dastard 
 ly one evilest bastard even you askin for me to be po 
 lite to people is like me havin my teeth pulled




so step inside a dimension   the demented side of a mind that's 
like the inside of an engine while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded if i didn't mention i'll lose my mind and my temper
you'll be the first one who finds i'm offensive
got him climbin the fences lost some time to addiction
but look up "rhyme" in the dictio nary i'm in the picture
eminem is the synonym for it i'm an enigma
fuck it let's get to the meat  i'm gonna skip the
veg and potatoes edumacator
they are shit legends are made of spit treacherous data
shit that you would say to
your worst enemy this wretched is what you get when you mix treach with a jada
then combine 'em with method man and redman with metham 
 phetamines in each left hand in each right is a sledgeham 
 mer and pajamas standin in front of a webcam
beatin themselves in the head 'til russell lets 'em off def jam
maybe i need my head exam'ed hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hangin from his ceiling drippin with a bed pan
i need meds swear to god cause if i go off the edge
ti ain't talkin me off the ledge man
heartthrob at a fart ahh nah more like a smart slob
part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob 
 ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the walmart walls
little baby with large balls
fuck mud slingin i'm blood flingin
there's nothing on this fucking earth better then being the king of
the playground i hate the swings but i love bein
an underdog cause when i'm pushed i end up swingin 



it's like i'm in this dirt diggin up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it won't work
all it takes is one song on the radio you're   right back on it
remindin me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryin to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i'm comin for closure
don't suppose an explanation i'm owed for
the way that you turned your back on me just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over; you can just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothin
you ruined mine but you seem to be doin fine well i've never recovered
but tonight betcha that what ya
'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind's sayin "let it go fuck this"
heart's sayin "i will once i bury this bitch alive hide the shovel
and then drive off in the sunset and"


i flee the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth but it's easier to justify
what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i run i run follow me i run i run
i just hate to be the bad guy


and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep gettin away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow knit wit
thought some time would pass and i'd forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles you expect me to just get
over him pretend he never exis ted
may be gone but he's not forgotten and don't think cause he's been out the picture
so long that i've stopped the plottin and still ain't comin to getcha
you're wrong and that shit was rotten and the way you played him's same shit you did to
me cold have you any idea the
shit that i've gone through feelings i harbor all this pent up resentment i hold onto
not once you call to ask me how i'm doin letters you don't respond to 'em
fuck it i'm comin to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you
poof then i'm gone voosh   and




follow me i run i run follow me i run i run


i've been drivin around your side of this town
like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now finally i found
your new address park in your drive feel like i've been waitin on this moment all of my life and
it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and i'm duckin on the side of your house see it's
sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but ain't here for your empathy
i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
it's revenge that i seek so i sneak
vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potential i peaked/peeked
continue to peep still bent low
then keep tappin the glass lightly then start to crescendo
sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man
door handle's unlocked shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hack up a lung 
like you picked an axe up and swung
stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk
by one of your fans irony's spectacular huh now who's a faggot you punk
and here's your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
it's just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it
we're in a car right now wait here comes my favorite lyric
"i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
and hey here's the sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
well how's this for publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m mathew mitchell
bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the
best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near hope we don't get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
ohh god police
ahhh hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan slim chauvinist pig
drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the bridge
haha big bro it's for you slim this is for him
and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again
 




i also represent 
anyone on the receivin end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
i'm your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approachin its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again
back's to the wall i'm stackin up all them odds
toilet's clogged yeah cause i'm talkin a lot of shit but i'm backin it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished "i am your lack of a conscience
i'm the ringin in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eatin your vocal chords after your concerts
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered
comin back on ya every woman you insult batter
but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade and mathew and stan's just symbolic
of you not knowin what you had 'til it's gone cause
after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are callin
your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of 'em
i'm the hindsight to say 'i told you so' foreshadows of all the
things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughingstock of rap who can't call it quits
when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have
but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have
left to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother
so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packin a wallop"
so one last time i'm back
'fore it fades into black and it's all over
behold the final chapter in the saga
tryin to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts
blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh as we pick up where the last "mathers" left off  
i can feel the heat risin everything is on fire
today's a painful reminder of whyyyyy 
we can only get brighter the further you put it behind ya
but right now i'm on the inside 
lookin out cause


 standin in the flaaaaames
and it's a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light


yesterday was the tornado warning today's like the morning after
your world is torn in half you wake in its wake to start the mournin process
and rebuildin you're still a work in progress
today's a whole new chapter it's like an enormous ass uh
thunderstorm has passed ya
you weathered it and poke its eye out with the thorn bush that ya
used to smell the roses stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is
stuffed so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas ped 
 al and hit the corner fast the
more assertive never lookin back may hit the curb but every day's a new learning curve as ya
steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have ta
to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage
cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ash 
 es and that hurt that you have you just converted to gas 
 oline and while you're burnin the past stand in that inferno and chant




you're so familiarized with what havin to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died cause you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive which means you will survive
although today you may weep cause you're weakened
and everything seems so bleak and hopeless the light that you're seekin
it begins to seep in that's the only thing keepin
you from leapin off the mother freakin deep end
and i'm pullin for you to push through this feelin
and with a little time that should do the healin
and by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willin to forgive 'em
even after all that shit you've been put through this feelin of resilience is buildin
and the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building
you're sealed in but you're fire proof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin
you look down cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
as time passes things change every day
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remainin the same
but tomorrow today's goin down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze
so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire from the heat
exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief as you say goodbye to the grief
it's like watchin the walls melt in your prison cell but you've extinguished this livin hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream




i feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn
rising a phoenix from the flames
i have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
not with fists but with wings that i will fly
and

and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
with the ugly kardashian lamar oh
sorry yo we done both set the bar low
far as hard drugs are though
that's the past but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
and girl i ain't got no money to borrow
but i am tryin to find a way to get you a loan car note
ohh~ marshall mathers
shithead with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
kangols and car heart less cargoes
girl you're fixin to get your heart broke
don't be absurd ma'am; you bird brain baby
i ain't called anybody "baby" since birdman   unless you're a swallow 
word rick word man you heard; but don't be discouraged girl
this is your jam unless you got toe jam



  

"or eminem has a full line of chainsaws"
"eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem em in em"
"marshall mathers eminem the rapper eminem"


"who can say for sure
 perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
 if science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
 society would reap a great benefit"


i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer case of tourette's
fuck fuck fuck can't take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges
like "this is how i'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimmin scissors with razor edges"
imagination's dangerous it's the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation i guess
cause i feel like a little bitch this predicament's
despicable i'm sick of just gettin pushed it's ridiculous
i look like a freakin wuss a pussy this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was 6 and shook
this fucker was 12 and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book
now there's usin your head   momma always said


momma always said "if you had a brain you'd be dangerous
a brain you'd be dangerous"
i'ma prove you wrong momma i'ma grow one day to be famous
and i'ma be a pain in the anus
i'ma be the bomb i'ma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness
momma always said "son if you had a brain you'd be dangerous"
guess it pays to be brainless


fast forward some years later a teenager this is a fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week it's complete
it's usually once a month this is some feat
i've accomplished they've stomped me into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you beat down and be upbeat
when you don't have no thing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
cause you're doomed from the start it's like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task practicin trash
talkin in a trance locked in my room yeah but i got some plans momma
these damn rhymes are fallin out of my pants pocket i can't stop it
and i'm startin to blend in more in school this shit helps for sure
i'm gettin more self assured than i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore
i done put a stop to that threw my first punch end of story
still in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory in this gourd
there's a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironin board a bench a wrench a ore winch an attention whore
everything but a brain but dome's off the fuckin chain like an independent store
something's wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i don't
cause i'd probably be dahmer   cause momma always said




now my mom goes wamp wamp wamp
cause i'm not that smart but i'm not dumb
i was on the bottom of the pile gettin stomped
but somehow i came out on top 

i told you one day i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out yo
i'm nice y'all fuck it i'm out cold
now everywhere i go they scream out "go" i'm 'bout to clean house yo
i'm lysol now i'm just household
out sold the sell outs freak the hell out middle america hear 'em yell out
in terror they were so scared
and those kids just about belted out whatever spouted or fell out
my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
inappropriate so be it i don't see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as
motherfuckin difficult yeah 'til then hopefully ya
little homos get over your fears and phobias
it's okay to be scared straight they said i provoked queers
'til emotions evoke tears my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
you motherfuckin 
who the fuck would've thunk that one little ol' mc'd
be able to take the whole culture and re upholstery it
and boy they did flock can't believe this little hick locked
this hip hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that white trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin like six blocks
from a kid rock/insane clown posse concert in mid oc 
 tober and god forbid i 
see the wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all cause
i'll turn into the unabomber   momma always said




"insaneness" ain't even a word you stupid fuck
neither is "ain't"

girl you give me writer's block i'm at a loss for words
 my mind's as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge never seen no ass as large as yours
how much that cost that's what i call a cause to splurge
you drive me bonkers i'm about to get my swerve on for sure
 thought i was pimpin 'til i felt like nas the first
date cause i think i gave you power when i gave you flowers
in a vase a box of chocolates throat lozengers cough drops and certs
 probably should've never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
should've been one of the first signs that caused alert
man we jumped in too fast cause since then i just can't be apart from her
cause nobody's body's awesomer
i lust her and she loves me cause i'm popular
but you know this ain't love

  
you know this ain't love   ohh no
you know this ain't love
you know this ain't love   ohhhh no
you know this ain't love 
it's desperation 
hey 
it's desperation 
hey 


you were obviously oblivious to me i
swore i was just invisible to you 'til i went to the lengths i did to meet ya
cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning now i'm in disbelief i
never knew that this could be such misery ah
cause now you see nothing but me and
i don't see nothing but you and i'm about to flip cause we are
super glued in we stuck to each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually which is to cling on scared to be a 
 lone can't specifically de scribe it i just can't seem to give a reason
that's definitive just need ya talkin 'bout "i live and breathe ya"
and you pretend to be as mentally and 
physically addicted to me as wiz khalifa is to reefer
don't wanna be without you don't wanna be with you neither
bitch put me in a situation in which it's both i wish to seek cause
this ain't love




i just want you to myself don't wanna share you with no one else ah
"what the fuck you whispering for
you get on my nerves you make me sick i think our relationship it seems to
be on the fritz i mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine i think you need to
finish developing a little more mentally too
get the picture" that's a negative alicia
i will never give the keys up to the crib ever again no visa
not even a gift certificate from tiffany's ya
better have an epiphany slut guess what what the lease up
i'm just mad the time it took to disco 
 ver you were usin me for loot like i used you for looks hoe thought you was too good for me huh
yeah toots used to be my carrie underwood i was your lumberjack
but i can't stomach this i'm leavin you i'm not coming back
she said "the fuck with that where's my louisville slugger at"
she grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head i barely ducked and that's
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
steel toe it would've put a 100 yard field goal through the uprights




it's desperation

"don't front" 
"don't fr fr front"


used to get bent now i represent to the fullest
pencil is full of insolent bullets
i'm like a doberman pinscher pit bull and a rott'
mixed with a toxic the plot begins to thicken i
begin to spittin like vintage 'pac demented
demonic sinister ever since the doc replenished
me the day he gave me that shot when i was just about to quit
so to not see him with me would be a shocking image
and i'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
and knock me to the canvas even the boxing critics
know that if i get off to a rocky start i'll always have a rocky finish
eat me broccoli spinach cocky nope but i hope i offended
you when i told ya how dope i am at this
and put emphasis on the "dope" so when names come up
in that conversation of who's the dopest better throw mine in it
and don't mind me while i remind you of the flow
you won't find anywhere when it fires and i unload my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it   reload in no time
let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by so you know i meant it/minute
 in school i was so shy timid
two pairs of jeans i'd alternate bummy clothes i 'member
beggin my mom for k mart macgregors cause those were new
saint vincent de paul those pony's were used and no size fitted
but kiss them old days adios i did it
they said i was a gimmick now i'm the one that those guys mimic
now you fuckers don't wanna go startin no argument
cause you know i'll win it name a flow that's mo' authentic
and don't front


don't front you know i gotcha open
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
don't front you know i gotcha open word
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
don't front you know i gotcha open kid
yo why you frontin you know i gotcha open kid


rest in piece to big proof you was a beast
you lyrically mirrored me
molded my flow off of you your spirit's flowin through me
i love you doody without you i feel so incomplete
i'm no king no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
i'm a thorn in your side get thrown into a throne better watch the fuckin tone that you speak
feel like i'm in a zone i'm in a whole different league
on my motherfuckin own it's just me
no opponents can compete and i've never been known to retreat
from beef beep beep follow trends or wallow in defeat
i'm still hungry as fuck but can't even say bon appetit
cause i don't know what to eat fuckin microphone or the beat
bitch nobody's mind works like mine it's nose to the grind 
 stone time holmes your mind's blown cause i rhyme
like i'm still tryin to get signed
up in the ebony show case with denaun screamin 
never asked you like my shit from the git
i'd rather ask you to wipe my ass bitch
you had you a nice run now take a hike
i ever meet my match i'ma strike that bitch first cause on the mic
i gotta represent the real rappers
the real rappers get their motherfuckin skills crackin
word to buckshot and dru ha why the fuck not you don't like it suck a cock
almost forgot before i signed with the doc
i almost signed with 
cause rawkus didn't make no offers and motherfuck loud they jerked me around so what's up now
wow how much of an asshole would i sound
like rubbin it in and holdin some grudge now
but don't front



  
late at night used to catch a buzz couldn't write
now i write the type of shit to make you wipe
but wear diapers cause you might
leave a streak i'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
it's hard to decipher which cypher i might jump in tonight
cause i'm hyper or somethin needin someone or somethin is light 
 ing the fire under me it's breathin new life
it's like i already died once i guess some people only live twice
and it's funny my days of bein broke are so long ago i lost all concept of money
but you dimes won't get a fuckin nickle from me
oh shit i'm down on one knee
i'm havin a stroke of genius "elizabeth i'm comin to you honey"
uhh from boy to man
and still make a whore moan/hormone like a thyroid gland
i'm in another category man
don't group me up with them pop stars i never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy band
no offense yes offense
precedence has been set that'll never get met
middle finger pressed against moby's nose
shout to obie the curtain's closed on my show
 you can't take it ohh
got a whole generation of rappers comin up that are nutty with the flow
but convince me you've heard an mc since me who's this good with the fuckin mincing of words
without mincing words that'll make you feel like i'm pinching a nerve
whose as mentally disturbed you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
it'll be like my skin bein indian burned
ahh bitch there isn't one when will you learn
never been served if memory serves
i'll battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
don't front


you know i gotcha open kid yo stop frontin
you know i gotcha open word life

yeah i was tryin to figure out the difference
but i think i think the lines are startin to get blurred


i'm in a strange place
i feel like ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
cause i'm mentally rearrangin his face
i need a change of pace   cause the pace i'm workin at's dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roastin 'em
cause that's where most of my anger is based/baste
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt you aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanye's jay's wayne's and the drake's
i'm frustrated cause ain't
no more n'sync now i'm all out of wack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is i'm strapped
for battles sucka duck crawl out the back
it's a bar fight prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also
and i ain't stoppin 'til the swear jar's full
"you done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting sarah marshall"
 oh my bad slut
and next time i show up in court i'll be naked and just wear a law suit
judge be like "that's sharp how much that motherfucker cost you
smart ass you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
you're so fuckin gravy marshall; i should start callin you au jus
cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
evil twin take this beat now it's all you
i believe people can change  but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
so satanic k mart chains panic cause they can't even spin back the curse words
cause they're worse when they're reversed
motherfucker 
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screamin "fuck shit fuck~" adult with a childish like arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like "merits
fuck that i'd rather be loud and i like swearin"
from the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics
dreamy eyes" but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
opposition felt the opposite sometimes i listen
and revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
haha hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines   where i'm at
and the way i feel now feel like i might just strike first then ignore the replies

  
there's darkness closin in 
there it goes again 
it controls my pen 
but that ain't me it's my evil twin

but he's just a friend 
who pops up now and again 
so don't blame me 
blame him it's my evil twin



"welcome back to the land of the living my friend
 you have slept for quite some time"


so who's left lady gaga mess with the bieber

destiny when on the steps i met deshaun
at osborn i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes while i wrote rhymes tryin to get props for 'em
cause i took book smarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleepin i made 'em stop snorin made 'em break out the popcorn
now i've been hip hop in its tip top form
since nwa was blarin through my car windows leanin on the horn
screamin "fuck tha police" like cop porn

fuck top 5 bitch i'm top 4
and that includes biggie and 'pac whore
and i got an evil twin so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for
and crazy as i am i'm much tamer than him

hi faggot look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs

peace to whitney geez just hit me
that i should call the loony police to come get me

hoe i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman try to fuck me over it won't hurt
don't try to fix me i'm broke so i don't work
so are you but you're broke cause you don't work
haha but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
cause we are the same bitch

"what is a nightmare
 the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare" 


i used to think i had bad luck but i wasn't superstitious
'til one day i grew suspicious
when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start a new be ditchin
missouri from michigan didn't work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i can't do this again
mom please stick to a decision   discipline last thing i wanna do is listen
she's like lex luthor bitchin and rules are krypto 
 nite so the walls i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into 'em runnin through the kitchen
pretendin to be blind superman cause i had no super vision
but i did have a super power though i could turn into invisible kid
disappear outta sight like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion


"i remember it clearly even today"


move back to michigan again to live with
my grandma nan always itchin for somethin to do was flippin
through the radio stations one day and discovered this dj who was mixin
i'll say it to this day if you ain't listened
to the wizard you ain't have a fuckin clue what you was missin
i'd zone out with my headphones all i remember doin's wishin
for shoes fuck them stupid pumas bitch it's all about them new edition
troops you get them ll cool j coolin systems
think i finally maneuvered to 8 mile and hoover and somehow i saw my future is in
this that's how i knew my mission
little boombox boomin spittin practicin numerous writtens
when i sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit couldn't wait to play him my new shit he'd go cuckoo ballistic
go through the roof for his shit
it's like we knew the instant we touched a mic that both of us two existed
to do this shit never quit too persistent


"we are the underground empire"


started a group of misfits proof had a proposition
if we all band together there ain't no stoppin this shit
come up with aliases bi polar opposites and
be ready to come off the top with sharp precision
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin
they'd take your spot if someone got to rippin you and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once it ain't knockin again
it tried ding dong ditchin shit i fuckin got that bitch in
a headlock cut off his oxygen slim
it's not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind now i got a pot to piss in
spot in that top position coppin over the opposition
lookin like a dog that's pissin leg up on the competition
promisin complete dominance sugar ray robinson
i'm in the league muhammad's in ali's my colleague bombin 'em
probably end up on top of 'em stompin 'em like ndamukong
i'm russian/rushin like a ukrainian ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme i spit in a rhyme's face
so name the time place to battle bitch i'm still in that mindstate
don't make me step on you and make you whine/wine grapes
cry babies maybe my way that i use words
is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts shit no wonder you're sore losers
now where's your poop birds ooh no more drippin in bird shit
this song's a self empowerment surgin
words of encouragement but discouragin
the rappers the rap game's god but the name's not james todd i'm just a word smith
so let these words lift
cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't workin out each verse is
more merciless than the first is and you ain't gotta wear no shoes and shirt
in this bitch to get served bloodthirst revenge of the nerds 


"know too that you'll not escape my vengeance"


and i'm the kid with them ears like dumbo's gone
word to uncle ron i'm turnin into an non humble don
you blonde dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so start the show but i need a drumroll 'fore i go on
better back away from the front row get launched show you i'm
bigger than dikembe mutumbo on the fuckin jumbotron
i'm a juggernaut you do not wanna rumble you bomboclaats
i'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin yawn
so mow the fuckin lawn your asses are blades of grass
and i'm fuckin up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres and eighth of that
was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper
oh look my notebook looks smoke cooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
charred debris floatin like oak wood
was burnin return of the no good
and i won't quit


"and the next thing i knew something came crawling up from below
 something that made godzilla look like a plain cat"


and it don't quit won't change it's like a groundhog's day
so crowd around y'all cause you may sayin bye bye y'all hey
i'm a monster mush   i'm a monster mush
i'm a monster mush   i'm a ohh
turnin into a monster mush
i'm a monster mush   with my


"dick in your mouth all day" 


"i'm not so sure i want to know from whence it came
 but the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
 there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing" 

mom i know i let you down
and though you say the days are happy
why is the power off and i'm fucked up
and mom i know he's not around
but don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself another drink yeah


i guess we are who we are
headlights shinin in the dark night i drive on
maybe we took this too farrrrrr


i went in head first never thinkin about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
"cleaning out my closet" and all them other songs but regardless i don't hate you cause ma
you're still beautiful to me cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare and forever we can drag this on and on
but agree to disagree that gift for me up under the christmas tree
don't mean shit to me you're kickin me out it's 15 degrees
and it's christmas eve "little prick just leave" ma let me grab my fuckin coat
anything to have each other's goats why we always at each other's throats
especially when dad he fucked us both we're in the same fuckin boat
you'd think that it'd make us close  further away it drove
us but together headlights shine and car full of belongings still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old
and that's when i realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though   but




cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
but i'm sorry momma for "cleaning out my closet" at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so
never meant that far to take it though
cause now i know it's not your fault and i'm not makin jokes
that song i'll no longer play at shows and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan bein placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medication's taken over and your mental state's deterioratin slow
and i'm way too old to cry the shit is painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have cause
one thing i never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
but i'da flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chim i ney dressed as santa
kidnap 'em and although one has only met their grandma
once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leavin to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelmin sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to
thank you for bein my mom and my dad so
mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to
get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to lay it 'fore i'm dead the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt i guess we're crashin
so if i'm not dreamin i hope you get this message that i
will always love you from afar   cause you're my ma



  
i want a new life  one without a cause 
so i'm comin home tonight  well no matter what the cost
and if the plane goes down or if the crew can't wake me up
well just know that i'm alright; i was not afraid to die
oh even if there's songs to sing well my children will carry me
just know that i'm alright; i was not afraid to die
because i put my faith in my lil' girls so i'll never say goodbye cruel world
just know that i'm alright; i am not afraid to diiiiiiie




i want a new life

tell me where to go tell me what to do
i'll be right there for you
tell me what to say no matter if it's true
i'll say it all for you 


i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
cause i don't belong in this world that's why i'm scoffin
at authority defyin often flyin off at
the handle at my mom no dad so i am non com 
 pliant at home at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryin to diagnose why i have all these underlyin problems
thinkin he can try and solve 'em i'm outside chalkin
up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin
to myself either that or inside hidin off in
the corner somewhere quiet tryin not to
be noticed cause i'm cryin and sobbin
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talkin
some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker cause he said that i eyeballed him


and if you fall i'll catch you there
i'll be your savior from
all the wars that are fought inside your world
please have faith in my words
cause


this is my legacy legacy ehhhhhh
this is my legacy legacy ehhhhhh
there's no guarantee it's not up to me we can only see
that this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy


i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
cause sporadic as my thoughts come it's mind bogglin
cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said "sayonara"
then split but i don't give a shit i'm fine long as
there's batteries in my walkman
nothin's the matter with me shit look on the bright side least i ain't walkin
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which i've acquired parts that
i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even tryin to put up a fight it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin they're kinda givin me confidence
instead of tryin to escape through my comics
why don't i just blast a little somethin like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to that kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like "that's right fight's on bitch"
who woulda knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest
that's word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest




i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength to try and draw from
and get inspired off 'em
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit
now you shut up bitch i am talkin
thought i was full of horse shit and now you fuckin worship the ground on which i am walkin
me against the world so what i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 lions' offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplyin coffins
cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of brian balding 
 ers you're gon' die a ball licker i've been diabolic 
 al with this dialogue since '99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass in a flyin saucer
full of italian sausage
the most high exalting and i ain't halting
'til i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall
and this is my



somethin's burnin i can't figure out what 
it's either lust or a cloud of dust judgment is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of
 but i'm in somethin i don't know how to get outta
left my girl in the house alone is that my soon to be spouse's moan
and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to   busta bust her
the thought's scary yo though and it hurts brace
hope it ain't "here we go yo" cause my head already goes to worst case
scenario though in the first place
 but you confirmed my low end theory though
should've known when i made it all the way to 3rd bass
and that was only the first date could've made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face   first
"no  you don't  under  stand 
i  don't  do this for  anyone  ever" 
yeah that ain't what they all say i'll say
you can suck a softball through a straw used to be my fiancée
'til you sucked on wayne andré and kanye
lebron akon jay lil jon raekwon ma$e
polow da don dre dante ross james conway kwame
guess i'm gettin my g goddang jigga on eh
cause your name i'm beyon' sayin
but fuck it i'm movin on you women are all cra'y
but i'll probably always keep on playin the


"game of love  love "
"la la la la la love"


she doesn't love me no she don't love me no more
she hates my company guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before
and i told her

and i told her



i told that bitch   i'm a sucker for love you a sucker for dick
suckin dick in your momma tub then your granny walked in
told the stupid nigga to duck under the water he drowned like an abortion
they booked you for manslaughter   you beat the case and i called ya
 "sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
and kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
expensive heels you little fuckin ferris wheel
fuckin spinnin on me fuck you think we're gon' get married still
fuckin mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
fairy godmomma better tell you how i fuckin feel
like you should fuckin beat it or fuckin eat it while i'm on my period
now have a blessed day~"  bitch you serious
i'm in the mirror with this look on my face curious
why you ain't fuckin with me you cut me deep as cesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin him
his mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin cordial yeah i got some home trainin
that ain't what you like ain't it what about if i was famous
as marshall would you give fellatio in the carpool
cops pull us over they just wanna know if you gargle
singin   "i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasin her"
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
pity the fool and pity the fool in me i'ma live with the






so needless to say i'm feelin betrayed snatch my house key off her keychain
she jumps off wee bey from "the wire"'s dick now she's chasin me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliché it's all my fault anyway
she's turnin the tables i'm a beat break
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of attack beha 
 vior back together but forgot today was her b day
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstandin but just as i went to slam on the brakes
that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin brake line stepped on them fuckers eight times still goin 73 thank
god there's an exit comin up what the mother f u c k's
wrong with her hit the off ramp 'til i coasted
to a gosh damn halt hit a fuckin tree now
here she comes at full speed she's racin at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
snatch the bitch out her car through the window she's screamin
i body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
and created a sinkhole buried the stink hoe in it then paid to have the street re paved
 woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though cause she's layin next to me in bed
directly aimin a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up like "fuck it i've had it"
i'm checkin into rehab i confess i'm a static addict
i guess that's why i'm so clingy every girl i've ever had 
either says i got too much baggage or i'm too fuckin dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter i'm just a fuckin romantic
i fuckin love you you fuckin bitch combative possessive
in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said "hit the road" then after she left i sent that bitch a text
that said "be careful drivin don't read this and have a accident" she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes
never been a more compelling case than the model covered in l'oréal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape
'til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser/horser than tori spelling's face
still they swarm the gates
of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
'less you're andrea yates don't ask me for a date though you're late
well the sentiment's great   but wait think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood it's mainly cause of the game of
 wait "dinner at 8"
i have infinite hate in my blood it's mainly cause of the



i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
and you think i'm crazy; yeah you think i'm crazy


i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggers can't be choosy
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways
fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated when i blew see
but it was confusing cause all i wanted to do's be
the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
woo hit the lottery ooh wee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin a used mink
ironic cause i think i'm gettin so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin to lose sleep   one sheep two sheep
goin cuckoo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think
cause i'm




well that's nothin
oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh
oh ohhh oh ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhhh
well that's nothin
oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh
oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh


now i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
cause you never know when it could all be over tomorrow so i keep conjurin
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
"yeah ponderin'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losin your mind the way it wanders"
yodelodaley hee hoo i think it went wanderin
off down yonder and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i love's killin me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conkin me in the head keep knockin
nobody's home i'm sleep walkin
i'm just relayin what the voice in my head's sayin don't shoot the messenger
i'm just friends with the






call me crazy but i have this vision
one day that i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and i'm 
comin straight at mc's blood gets spilled and i'll
take you back to the days that i get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumped up feelin
and shit to say back to the kids who played 'em
i ain't here to save the fuckin children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates that's
great it's payback russell wilson fallin way back
in the draft turn nothin into somethin still can make that
straw into gold chump i will spin
rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straitjacket face facts
i am nuts for real but i'm okay with that
it's nothin i'm still friends with the

"ah fuck it" 
"look i was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings but"
"i'm only going to get this one chance"
"something's wrong i can feel it"
"it's just a feeling i've got like something's about to happen but i don't know what"
"if that means what i think it means we're in trouble big trouble
 and if he is as bananas as you say i'm not taking any chances"
"you were just what the doc ordered"


six minutes six minutes chka six minutes
six minutes slim shady you're on
chka chk chk chk on chka chk chk on
six minutes for six
for six minutes slim shady you're on
chka chk on chka chk on chka chk chk


i'm beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod


now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot
but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes/jeans i got a laptop in my back pocket

my pen'll go off when i half cock it got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin and a killin off it ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin on his nut sack i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables skill a holic   kill 'em all with
this flippity dippity hippity hip hop you don't really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappidy rap
packin a mac in the back of the ac' backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicin that
i'll still be able to break a motherfuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop f bombs feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin a rough time period here's a maxi pad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack while i'm masterfully constructin this masterpiece yeah
cause




now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
let me show you maintainin this shit ain't that hard that hard
everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like i have got

well to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful excuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid and did nothin but shoot for the moon since 
mc's get taken to school with this music cause i use it
as a vehichle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students
me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac n 
 wa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet run dmc and induct them into the motherfuckin rock 'n
roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alco hol of fame on the wall of   shame
you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
little gay lookin boy so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy 
you're witnessin a massacre/mass occur like you're watchin a church gatherin take place lookin boy
"oy vey that boy's gay" that's all they say lookin boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back and a "way to go" from your label every day lookin boy
hey lookin boy what ya say lookin boy i get a "hell yeah" from dre lookin boy
i'ma work for everything i have never asked nobody for shit get out my face lookin boy
basically boy you're never gonna be capable of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy
cause




the way i'm racin around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton no asgard asgard

so you be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omni potent
let off then i'm reloadin immediately with these bombs i'm totin
and i should not be woken
i'm the walkin dead but i'm just a talkin head a zombie floatin but i got your mom deep throatin
i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin in common poodle
i'm a doberman pinsch' yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
it's me my honesty's brutal
but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin
to censor you like that one line i said on "i'm back" from the mathers lp 1 when i
tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line add an ak 47 a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm
morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
you're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're
pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new ray gun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin to a man while he played piano
man oh man that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day "hey fab
i'ma kill you" lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed   j j fad
uhh samma lamma dooma lamma you assumin i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and it'll glue to you and
i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin audience a feelin like it's levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating
cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music
"oh he's too mainstream" well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
"it's not hip hop it's pop" cause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc throw on "lose yourself" and make 'em lose it
"i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use"
let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin any one of these verses that versus you
it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin you; how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
unhh~ school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongue in cheek fuck you
i'm drunk so satan take the fuckin wheel i'm asleep in the front seat
bumpin heavy d and the boys still chunky but funky
but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
they're askin me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination
but fuck it life's handin you lemons make lemonade then
but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then
don't mistake him for satan
it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard   be a king think not
why be a king when you can be a god

yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah


 marshall
 i don't have one
my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of a locomotive with rap i'm
loco it's like handin a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap "in a spasm
your music usually has 'em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan"
a jedi in trainin
colossal brain and thoughts of entertainin
but docile and impossible to explain and i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso paintin
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog
can't even find the page i was writin this rhyme on
oh it's on the ram page couldn't see what i wrote i write small
it says "ever since i drove a '79 lincoln with white walls had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard"
so as long as i'm on the clock punchin this time card
hip hop ain't dyin on my watch


now sometimes when i'm sleepin she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken  is she mine 
don't got time don't care don't have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone 
cause there's no rhyme or no reason for no thing
now  marshall
 i don't know him but i wonder
 haha



no if he had
he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn't be so mad my attitude wouldn't be so bad
yeah dad~
i'm the epitome and the prime example
of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
makes you wanna get up and start dancin
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin
laughin all the way to the bank lamping in my k mart mansion
i'm in the style department
with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but
with great power comes absolutely no responsiblity for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killin spree your honor i must
plead guilty cause i sparked the
revolution rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it

does that mean it belongs to me
cause i just happen to be
a white honkey devil with two horns that don't honk
but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause it's the


it's the time  of the season  when hate runs high 
and this time won't give it to you easy  
when i take back what's mine with pleasured hands
and torture everyone; that is my plan  my job here isn't done 
cause there's no rhyme or no reason for no thing
so  shady
 i don't give a fuck but i wonder
 doubt it haha



so yeah dad let's walk
let's have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knockin your block off this is all your fault
maybe that's why
i'm so bananas i ap peeled to all those walks of life
whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
cause i related to the struggles
of young america when their fuckin parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're rippin out their fuckin hair again it's hyster ical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uh oh better beware knuckle 
 heads the sign on my hustle
says don't knock the door's broken it won't lock
it might just fly open get cold cocked
you critics come to pay me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite zip your lip
if you dish it but can't take it too busy gettin
stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mr mathers as advertised on the flyers
so spread the word cause i'm promotin my passion 'til i'm passed out
completely brain dead rain man
doin the bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas i'm angrier
than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thing yeah
even this rhyme bitch
and quit tryin to look for a fuckin reason for it that ain't there
and i still am a criminal
10 year old degenerate grabbin on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predictin that this one'll go emerald
ha when will the madness end
how can it when there's no method to the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad i'm back at it again
yeah 

i own a mansion but live in a house
a king size bed but i sleep on the couch
i'm mr bright side glass is half full
but my tank's half empty gasket just blew


this always happens thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin
only option i have's mcdonalds' bathroom
in a public stall droppin a football
so every time someone walks in the john i get maddened
"shady what up" what c'mon man i'm crappin
and you're askin for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
oh that's odd i just happened
to run out of tissue yeah hand me that on second thought i'd be glad then
"thanks dawg name's todd a big fan"
i wiped my ass with it crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
told him "todd you're the shit" when's all of this crap end
can't pump my gas without causin an accident
pump my gas cut my grass i can't take out the fuckin trash
without someone passin through my sub harassin
i'd count my blessings but i suck at math
i'd rather wallow than bask sufferin succotash
but the antacid it gives my stomach gas
when i mix my corn with my fuckin mashed
potatoes so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots what the fuck is upper class
call lunch dinner call dinner supper
tupperware in the cupboard plasticware up the ass
stuck in the past ipod what the fuck is that
b boy to the core mule i'm as stubborn as


maybe that's why it feels so strange
got it all but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave de troit
it's the motivation that keeps me going

felt like i was in for a long bus ride i'd rather die than you not by my side
can't count how many times i vomited cried go to my room turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde nah on the inside you were jekyll and hyde i felt like my
whole relationship with you was a lie it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
cause if you coulda took my life you woulda it's like you put a
knife through my chest and pushed it right through to the other side of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
put up more of a fight but i couldn't at the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
take you back now what's the likelihood of that bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
cause this morning i finally stood up held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left and left me with nothin but shattered dreams and the life we coulda
had and what coulda been but i'm breakin out of this slump i'm in
pullin myself out of the dumps once again i'm gettin up once and for all fuck this shit

i'm done being your punchin bag it was november 31st today
would've been our anniversary two years but you left on the first of may
i wrote it on a calender was gonna call but couldn't think of the words to say
but they came to me just now so i put 'em in a verse to lay


and i thank you  cause you made me  a better person than i was
but i hate you  cause you drained me  i gave you all you gave me none
but if you blame me  you're crazy  and after all that's said and done
i'm still angry yeah i may be i may never trust someooooone


 yeah~


this is survival of the fittest
this is do or diiiiie
this is the winner takes it all
so take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh


wasn't ready to be no millionaire i was ill prepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
from the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
it was 'bout bustin raps and standin for somethin fuckin acronym
cut the fuckin act like you're happy i'm fuckin back again
with another anthem why stop when it doesn't have to end
it ain't over 'til i say it's over enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up i'm afraid of what'll
happen to them wolves when the thought of bein thrown 
into an alligator pit i salivate at it wait is up
hands up like it's 12 noon nah homie hold them bitches straighter up
wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos i ain't deflate enough
last chance to make this whole stadium erupt   cause




i can see the finish line with each line that i finish i'm so close
to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post 
and if i don't got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
they said i was washed up and got a blood bath
i'm not a rapper i'm an adapter i can adjust
plus i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top 5 in this muh'fucker and if i don't make the cut what like i give a fuck
i'ma light this bitch up like i'm drivin a truck
through the side of a pump
zero to sixty hop in and gun it like g unit without the hyphen i'm hypin 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up ehh might've mistook
me for bowin out i ain't takin a bow
i'm stabbin myself with a fuckin knife in the gut while i'm wipin my butt
cause i just shitted on the mic and i like gettin cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood you're in a fight with a nut
cause i'ma fight 'til i die or win bitin the dust
it'll just make me angrier wait let me remind you of what
got me this far picture me quittin
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
it's survival of what




so take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh

but don't come unless you come to battle now mount up jump in the saddle
this is it it's what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit can't defuse the wick
i don't do this music shit i'll lose my shit
ain't got shit to lose it's the moment of truth it's all i know how to do
as soon as i get thrown in the booth i spit
but my respect is overdue i'm showin you the flow no one do
cause i don't own no diploma for school i quit
so there's nothin for me to fall back on i know no other trade
so you'd better trade your fuckin mics in for some tool box es

so pull out your pliers and your screw dri vers
but i want you to doubt me i don't want you to buh lieve
cause this is somethin that i must use to suc ceed
and if you don't like me then fuck you self esteem

a llergic to failure cause every time i come close to it i just sneeze
but i just go ah choo then a chieve




so take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh

i'm gettin by with my wicked ways
i'm loadin up and i'm takin names
i wanna   dig my way to hell
i wanna   dig my way to hell


guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder ever heard of aspergers it's a rare condition
it's what you're sufferin from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditionin and you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzin
cause you got the windows up blarin the system in your chevrolet prism
the devil ain't on the level same as him picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him givin him an adjective an ass whippin so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully i verbally abuse verbs like they did somethin to me personally
used to get bullied so i cut class and ditch it   now i bully rap i'm the shit bag it 
cadillac from a k car my ass from a hole in the ground still can't tell 'em a part
came straight out the trailer park screamin i'm proud to shop at k mart and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad at the same walmart arguin over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whylin i don't give a fuck i don't play
bitch you think you saw this basket first your ass backwards like motherfuckin bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gapin hole in it flipped out ripped down the drapes
tied 'em around my neck went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell got an impaled by the gates so satan stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face 
and this ain't got nothin to do with a scale of bein gay little faggot but by the way
thoughts are gettin darker by the day
i'm a combination of skylar grey tyler the creator and violent jay
it's a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
i'm insane every rhyme i say sons/suns you like an ultraviolet ray
i'm sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat $1199 so come on and pile a plate
i'm throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise with the rhyme i'm spittin
while i'm shittin on competition in the meantime it's always mean time i'm gettin




i've been a career asshole i don't see why these people always got my back

 cident i had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish slaughter tracks
i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit i'm comin to get that quarter back
like ndamukong the drama can build your momma can ask me for my autograph
cause that cougar's a milf she's the oldest trick in the book but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight when i get on the mic i'ma snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach acid indigestion my suggestion's kaopectate
if it feels like i'm runnin away with the game it's cause i am don't speculate spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways lady you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
cry 'til you get puffy eyes red face but i'm leavin on this jet plane
you ain't fly you're an airhead and i'm sick of poundin a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
cause baby stable mentally i ain't
i need my meds i peed my bed i'm goin blind i don't see my legs
i keep on fallin down no wonder you can't stand me i need my cane
someone help me i think my face is melting if you felt these migraines
and see these maggots eat my brain this g i a 
 n t hole in my empty head if you read my mind you can see my pain
then you'd see why i be this way ever since i was knee high playin

psy psycho on a cyclone cycle spiraling h h here i go i`m outta control like no

and hi ho hand me my shovel i'm liable to dig my hole
deeper and it's off to h e double hockey sticks i go

too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
yeah
too late
i cant keep chasing em
taking my life like that
caught in a chase
25 to life


i don't think she understands the sacrifices that i've made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i would've stayed
but i've already wasted over half of my life i would've laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you
no more pain bitch you
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it
now my respect i demand it
i'ma take control of this relationship
command it and i'ma be the boss of you now goddamnit
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you why i've stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid
look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i ain't heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this i'll no longer have nothing left
but you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
and i won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
you know what you've done no need to go in depth
i told you you'd be sorry if i fucking left
i'd laugh while you wept
how's it feel now yeah funny ain't it you neglected me
did me a favour though my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate but it's


too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase 25 to life


i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
till i snap
don't think i'm loyal all i do is rap
i can not moonlight on the side
i have no life outside of that
don't i give you enough of my time
you don't think so do you
jealous when i spend time with the girls
why i'm married to you still man i don't know
but tonight i'm serving you with papers i'm divorcing you
go marry someone else and make em famous
and take away there freedom like you did to me
treat em like you don't need em and they ain't worthy of you
feed em the same shit that you made me eat
i'm moving on forget you oh
now i'm special i ain't feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this
helplessness
imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chewed me up and spit me out
i fell for this so many times
it's ridiculous
and still i stick with this
i'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
you're addictive as they get
evil as they come vindictive as they make em
my friends keep asking me why i cant just walk away from
i'm addicted
to the pain the stress the drama
i'm drawn in shit i guess i'm a mess
cursed and blessed
but this time i
aint changing my mind
i'm climbing out this abyss
you screaming as i walk out that ill be missed
but when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
you left me off your list
fuck you hip hop

artist: eminem

song:   almost famous
typed by: jeebs67@gmailcom


i can almost taste it

i can almost taste it
i can almost save it
this shit makes no sense to me
what does it all mean
i can almost taste it


yeah i can't stop now
this maybe be the last chance i get
to be famous


you dream of trading places
i have been changing faces
you can not fill these shoes
there is too much too lose
wake up behind these trenches
you run around defenseless
there is too much too lose
you can not fill these shoes
i just want to be famous
but be careful what you wish for


i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist they call me slim roethlisberger
i go bezerker than a fed up post office worker
a mark her with a mossberg i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you sure did shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
i faced her around but his fangs come out
get your brains blown out that's what i call 
blowing your mind when i come back
like nut on your spine i'm a thumb tack
that you slept on son
now here i come screaming attack like i just stepped on one
low on the totem till he showed 'em
defiance giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit
his britches he out grow'd em
he's so out cold he's knocked out of the south pole
and nobody fucks with him
rigamortis and post mortem
he's dying of boredom
take your best rhymes record 'em
then try to flaunt 'em
he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
shit stained drawers
you gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips 'em in pf chang's sauce
game's up homie hang it up like some crank calls
you think i'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
i'm almost famous


i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that ain't happening again
i'm at your throat like strep i step strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand
some are just stored in my mem ory
some i wrote on a napkin i do what i have to to win
pullin out all stops any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers how the fuck are they mike meyers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whacko fore i take a shit in his jack o lantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick dick's too short a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick
you call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger matter fact i need a lawyer
i just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like verne troyer
y'all are eminem backwards you're mini mes
see he's in a whole nother weight class
hes slugs your bb's your bean bag bullets
you're full of it; you were just in his cd's
left at infinite now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d r e
he's almost famous


now there he goes in dre's studio cuppin his balls
screaming the wood off the panel and cussing the paint off the walls
spewing his hate to these haters showing no love for these broads
he ain't given them shit he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
with the scars till abraham lincoln is screaming out ahh
these metaphors and similes ain't similar to them not at all
if they don't like it they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
and eat shit while they at it he's fucking had it he's mad at the whole world
so go to hell and build a snowman girl
the bullies become bullied and pussies get pushed
then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me
cus i ain't looking back only forward this whole spot blowing
who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
and while i'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these winners and lords
so bare witness to some biblical shit
as a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
he did it he made it he's finally famous
yeah you know technically
i'm not even really supposed to be here right now
so fuck it might as well make the most of it

i don't know why i'm so i'm so cold beat bangs i don't need to say
i guess this is how you made me

i'm going through changes i'm going through changes


lately i really
feel like i'm roll'n for delph like philly
feel like i'm lose'n control of myself
i sincerely apologize if all that i sound like
is i'm complaining but life keeps on complicating
and i'm debating on leaving this world this evening
even my girls can see that i'm grieving
i try and hide it but i can't
why do i act like i am all high and mighty
when inside i'm dying i am finally realize'n i needhelp
can't do it myself too weak
two weeks i've been having ups and down
going through peaks and valleys
dilly dallying around with the idea
of ending this shit right here
i'm hating my reflection
i walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
i can't stand what i look like yeah
i look fat but what do i care
i give a fuck only thing that i fear is hailey
i'm afraid that if i close my eyes then i might see hershit




i lock myself in the bedroom bathroom
napping at noon yeah dad's in a bad mood
he's always snapping at you
marshall what happened that you
can't stop with these pills and you've falling off with your skills
and your own fans are laughing at you
it become a problem you're too pussy to tackle
get up be a man stand a real man woulda had this shit handled
know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
they say proof just flipped out homie just whipped out and bust
nah it ain't like doody to do that
he wouldn't fuck'n shoot atnobody he'd fight first
but dwelling on it only makes the night worse
now i'm popping vikes percs and methadone pills
yeah em tight verse you killed it
fuck'n drug dealers hang around me like yes men
and they gon' do whatever i says whenever i says it
it's in their best interest to protect their investment
and i just lost my fuck'n best friend so fuck it i guess then

  
don't know what i'm going through but i just keep on going through changes


my friends can't understand this new me
that's understandable man but think how bananas you'd be
you'd be an animal too
if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
and everybody's look'n at you
whacha want me to do
i'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
fame is starting to give me an excuse
to be at a all time low
i sit alone in my home theatre watching the same damn dvd of the
first tour the last tour he was still alive
and it hurts so i fast forward
sleeping pills would make me feel alright
and if i'm still awake in the middle of the night
i just take a couple more yeah you're motherfucking right
i ain't slowing down for no one
i am almost homeward bound
almost in a coma yeah homie come on dole em out
daddy don't you die on me
daddy better hold your ground
fuck don't i know the sound of that voice
yeah baby hold me down

  
don't know what i'm going through but i just keep going through changes


wake up in the hospital full of tubes
plus somehow i'm pulling through
swear when i come back i'ma be bullet proof
i'ma do it just for proof
i think i should state a few
facts cuz i may not get a chance again to say the truth
see it just hit me that what if i would not have made it through
i think about the things that i would have never got say to you
i'd never get to make it right so here's what i came to do
hailey this one is for you whitney and alaina too
i still love your mother that'll never change
think about her every day we just could never get it together hey
wish there was a better way for me to say it
but i swear on everything i'll do anything for her on any day
there are just too many things to explain
when it rains guess it pours guess it does
wish there wasn't any pain
but i can't pretend there ain't
i ain't placing any blame i ain't pointing fingers
heaven knows i've never been a saint
i know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
and just today i looked at your picture almost as if to say
i miss you sub consciously wish it didn't end this way
but i just had to get away don't know why i don't know what else to say
i guess i'm

  
don't know what i'm going through but i just keep going through changes
just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie


i can't tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate it's like i'm huffin paint
and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates
me she fuckin hates me and i love it wait
where you goin "i'm leavin you" no you ain't
come back we're runnin right back here we go a gain
it's so insane cause when it's goin good it's goin great
i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed
i snapped who's that dude i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength

  "i love the way you lie"


you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're wit 'em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get 'em
now you're gettin fuckin sick of lookin at 'em
you swore you'd never hit 'em   never do nothin to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face spewin venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over it controls ya
both so they say you're best to go your separate ways guess that they don't know ya
cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
it's a different day sound like broken records playin over
but you promised her next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance life is no nintendo game
but you lied again; now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane/pain

  "i love the way you lie"


now i know we said things did things that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me
when it comes to love you're just as blinded baby please
come back it wasn't you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time there won't be no next time
i apologize even though i know it's lies i'm tired
of the games i just want her back i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin leave again i'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire
i'm just gonna

  "i love the way you lie"
yeah it's been a ride
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if you're tryin to get out just follow me
i'll get you there


i'm not afraid 
to take a stand 
everybody 
come take my hand 
we'll walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road 


you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin i do it i don't give a damn
what you think i'm doin this for me so fuck the world feed it beans
it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin me
i'ma be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who looked down on me i'm tearin down your balcony
no if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
from "infinite" down to that last "relapse" album he's
still shittin whether he's on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
he's married to the game like a fuck you for christmas his gift is a curse
forget the earth he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe




okay quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your fillings instead of gettin crowned you're gettin capped
and to the fans i'll never let you down again i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
let's be honest that last "relapse" cd was ehhh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i ain't goin back to that now
all i'm tryin to say is get back click clack blaow
cause i ain't playin around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryin to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didn't this fuckin black cloud
still follows me around   but it's time to exorcise these demons
these muh'fuckers are doin jumpin jacks now




and i just can't keep living this way
so starting today i'm breaking out of this caaaaage
i'm standing up i'ma face my demons
i'm manning up i'ma hold my ground
i've had enough now i'm so fed up
time to put my life back together right now 

it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally
for you so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did cause believe me you
i've been through the wringer but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise 
to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause i'm raising the bar
i'd shoot for the moon but i'm too busy gazin at stars
i feel amazing and i'm not


"love love"

"love love love"

"don't hurt me don't hurt me no more no more"
"love love"


young money yeah uhh
throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
but it's fuck the world get a child out her
yeah my life a bitch but you know nothin 'bout her
been to hell and back i can show you vouchers
i'm rollin sweets i'm smokin sour
married to the game but she broke her vows
that's why my bars are full of broken bottles
and my nightstands are full of open bibles
uhh i think about more than i forget
but i don't go around fire expectin not to sweat
and these niggaz know i'll lay 'em down make your bed
bitches try to kick me while i'm down i'll break your leg
money outweighin problems on a triple beam
i'm stickin to the script you niggaz skippin scenes
uhh be good or be good at it
fuckin right i got my gun semi cartermatic
yeah put the dick in they mouth so i guess it's fuck what they say
i'm high as a bitch up up and away man i'll come down in a couple of days
okay you want me up in a cage then i'll come out in beast mode
i got this world stuck in a safe combination is the g code
it's weezy motherfucker blood gang and i'm in bleed mode
all about my do' but i don't even check the peep hole
so you could keep knockin but won't knock me down
no love lost no love found

  
it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
you kicked me when i was down but what you say just don't 
 it don't   no more
   you get no 
you showed me nothin but hate you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around around and you don't

see these people's ears perk up as i begin to spaz with the pen
i'm a little bit sicker than most shit's finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff but i get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in
i ain't never givin in again caution to the wind complete freedom
look at these rappers how i treat 'em so why the fuck would i join 'em when i beat 'em
they call me a freak cause i like to spit on these pussies 'fore i eat 'em
man get these wack cocksuckers off stage where the fuck is kanye when you need him
snatch the mic from him bitch i'ma let you finish in a minute yeah that rap was tight but i'm
'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so ya might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference 
when i rip the stage and tear it in half tonight it's an
adrenaline rush you feel the bass thump from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd you can see the sparks from hot metal
cold hearted from the day i bogarted the game my soul started to rot fellow
when i'm not even at my harshest you can still get roasted cause marsh is not mellow
'til i'm topplin from the top i'm not gonna stop i'm standin on my monopoly board
that means i'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
when you're so good that you can't say it cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
people just get sick cause you spit these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore 
and you could never break my stride you'll never slow the momentum at any moment
i'm 'bout to blow you'll never take my pride i'm killin the flow slow venom any opponent
is gettin no mercy mark my words ain't lettin up relentless i smell blood
i don't give a fuck keep givin 'em hell where was you when i fell and needed help up

i put both hands on your throat i sit on top of you squeezin
'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick ain't no possible reason
i can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks then i let you go and just give

and i would've did anything for you
to show you how much i adored you

and i'm aimin right at youuuu right at youuuu
250 thousand miles on a clear night in june
and i'm so lost without youuuu without youuuu without youuuuuuu
aiyyo before i start this song man
i just wanna thank everybody for bein so patient
and bearin with me over these last couple of years
while i figure this shit out


is anybody out therrrre
it feels like i'm talkin to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i've come from 
can anybody hear meeee yeah
i guess i keep talkin to myself
it feels like i'm goin insane
am i the one who's crazy yeah


whoooa whoooa

whoooa whoooa whoooa



so why in the world do i feel so alone
nobody but me i'm on my own
is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel
if there is then let me hear just so i know that i'm not the only one


i went away i guess and opened up some lanes
but there was no one who even knew i was goin through growin pains
hatred was flowin through my veins on the verge of goin insane
i almost made a song dissin lil wayne
it's like i was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin
i felt horrible about myself he was spittin
and i wasn't anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
almost went at kanye too god it
feels like i'm goin psychotic thank god that i didn't do it
i'da had my ass handed to me and i knew it
but proof isn't here to see me through it
i'm in the booth poppin another pill tryin to talk myself into it
are you stupid you're gon' start dissin people for no reason
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
you're lyin to yourself you're slowly dyin you're denyin your health
is declinin with your self esteem you're cryin out for help

  

  
marshall you're no longer the man that's a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is i'm wallowin self loathin and hollow
bottoms up on the pill bottle maybe i'll hit my bottom tomorrow
my sorrow echoes in this hall though 
but i must be talkin to the wall though i don't see nobody else

but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
i've turned into a hater i put up a false bravado
but marshall is not an egomaniac that's not his motto
he's not a desperado he's desperate his thoughts are bottled
inside him; one foot on the brake one on the throttle
fallin asleep with writer's block in the parking lot at mcdonald's
but instead of feelin sorry for yourself do somethin 'bout it
admit you got a problem your brain is clouded you pouted
long enough it isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
quit worryin 'bout what they do and do shady i'm fuckin goin crazy

  


so i picked myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore i drowned
hit my bottom so hard i bounced twice suffice this time around
it's different them last two albums didn't count
"encore" i was on drugs "relapse" i was flushin 'em out
i've come to make it up to ya now no more fuckin around
i got somethin to prove to fans cause i feel like i let 'em down
so please accept my apology i finally feel like i'm back to normal
i feel like me again let me formally
reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
the new me's back to the old me and homie i don't show no
signs of slowin up oh and i'm blowin up all over

locked in mariah's wine cellar all i had for lunch
was red wine more red wine and captain crunch
red wine for breakfast and for brunch
and to soak it up an in between snack crackers to munch
mariah whatever happened to us why did we have to break up
all i asked for was a glass of punch
you see i never really asked for much
i can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
a nasty break up with that latin hunk
luis miguelnick cannon better back the fuck
up i'm not playin' i want her back you punk
this is hello kitty bedspread satin funk
mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk
zepp' and eric clapton shaft frank zappa crunk
and yeah baby i want another crack at ya
you can beat me with any spatula that you want
i mean i really want you bad you cunt
nick you had your fun i've come to kick you in your sack of junk
man i could use a fresh batch of blood
so prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture


bagpipes from baghdad
when will it ever cease
for pete's sakes he's crazy to say the least
bagpipes from baghdad
what's goin through my mind
half the time when i rhyme we're blowin up like
bagpipes from baghdad
somebody turn the vacancy sign on
cause i'm gone blowing up my
bagpipes from baghdad
i run the streets and act
like a madman holdin a glad bag


you can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
i'm the miracle whip trickster
my sig nature sound when a tube of lipstick's around
i'm bound to put it on in an instant wow man
what an ensemble what an assortment of pharma 
 ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm my
cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle
never knew i could remind me so much of my momma
i'll cut ya like dahmer pull the butcher knife on ya
the size of a sword boy i'm like the fuckin red sonja
get it stuck in your cornea nice knowin ya norman
your so fuckin annoyin drop the shovel boy
you don't know what the fuck you're doin
i ain't playin no fuckin more
nick cannon you prick i wish you luck with the fuckin whore
every minute there's a sucker born snuck up on
malachi made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
chaka chaka khan chaka kahn
hit jason in the face with a hockey puck and tell em it's fuckin on
man what the fuck are ya doin
you're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
blowin your bagpipes from baghdad




in the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
i bet you they become heterosexual
nothing will stop me from molestin' you
titty fuckin' you til' your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
is what they said to the two conjoined twins
how's it going girlfriends you need a boyfriend
you need some ointment just set up an appointment
who's gonna see the doctor first we'll do a coin flip
i just got my one year sobriety coin chip
when the bad get goin how bad does the going get
baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin groins wit
each other especially when you're joined at the hip
i'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
an attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin shit
lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip 
cookie lookie even took me a polaroid flick




hghum day li laaa aaa aaa aaa aa aah aah 
lately i've been hard to reach i've been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me i'm reaching out for you


i'm just so fuckin depressed i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump but i need somethin to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm startin to feel distant again so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet
and i know some shit's so hard to swallow but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow i'll be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow but you'd have to walk a thousand miles


in my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
i'll be you let's trade shoes just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find look at shit through each other's eyes
but don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll oh ohh
they can all get fucked just stay true to youuuuuu so ohh oh
don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll oh ohh
they can all get fucked just stay true to youuuuuu so ohh oh


yeah
i think i'm startin to lose my sense of humor everything's so tense and gloom i
almost feel like i gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
i walk in it's like all eyes on me so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens a door for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin for extra attention i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fuckin man servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "ha
marshall you're so funny man you should be a comedian goddamn"
unfortunately i am i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles




nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em don't expect no help
now i could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place every school i went
i dreamed of bein that cool kid even if it meant actin stupid
aunt edna always told me "keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that"
meanwhile i'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryin to impress my friends no mo'
but i already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where you're sittin is probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10's let's see if you can fit your feet



  
lately i've been hard to reach i've been too long on my own 
everybody has a private world where they can be alone 
are you calling me are you trying to get through 
are you reaching out for me i'm reaching out for you 


yeah to my babies stay strong
daddy'll be home soon
and to the rest of the world
god gave you them shoes to fit you
so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself man be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful
so ohh oh
ahhhhh 
you sick bastard let me go
ahhh 
somebody please help
i don't wanna die please help me



better watch out sucka now i gotcha where i want ya
onslaught comin and i'm packin in my lunch a
bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra 
 ban van full of ganja now come on jump
man stop moshin marshall oh my god you're
doin the cha cha and the cucaracha with a quadra 
 plegic boogeyin down to frank sinatra
lindsay to the lohan naked while you let me watch ya
who'da knew da buddha'd do to me what it's done
such cynicism when there's ism in my system
blunt hypnotism lift a spliff up to my lips son
so much on my hands i got to give my kids a fist bump
christo pher reeves swimmin in my swim trunks
"mister help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once


once again they call me buffalo bill
buffalo bill buffa buffalo bill
skin 'em up hem 'em sew 'em up in those kilts
up in those kilts up a up in those kilts
man you don't want to go up in those hills
up in those hills up a up in those hills

buffalo bill buffa buffalo bill


always you can see him lurkin in the hallways
carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space
how the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
hide them in the wall well how long will the drywall take
well fuck it then i got nothing but time i'll wait
until it dries for the moment i guess you're all safe
after i sand it and buff it i guess that i'll paint

"breaking news detroit rapper eminem cancels his sold out european tour
 to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction
 to sleep medication we'll have more on this story as it develops"
"shady records recording artist obie trice has apparently
 survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be
 a random drive by shooting meanwhile eminem is rumored to be
 alienated on again/off again relationship with"
"this just in a tour bus involving eminem's bus"
"updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire
 at an after hours club we've learned that the rapper proof
 has been fatally shot"
"shady/aftermath recording artist"
"long time best friend of eminem and a member of the rap group d12"
"d12 back in the news again today"
"is it a sabbatical or the end the rumors and speculation
 continue to swirl around eminem he insists he's just taking a break
 but doubters believe he's retiring leaving us all to ask
 'will the real slim shady please stand up'"


so this is it this is what i wished for
just isn't how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shit'd be different
but somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it
and it became my cocaine i just couldn't quit
i just wanted a little bit
then it turned me to a monster i became a hypocrite
concert after concert i was rakin in the dough rollin in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
but i was losin my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
and there was no in between
you either loved it or hate it every cd critics gave it a 3
then three years later they go back and re rate it
then called "the slim shady lp" the greatest
"the marshall mathers" was a classic "the eminem show" was fantastic
but "encore" just didn't have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just ain't passed yet
a couple more years that shit'll be "illmatic"
and eight years later i'm still at it
divorced re married a felon a father sleepin pill addict
and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk


so be careful what you wish forrrr
cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten folllld
i said be careful what you wish forrrr
cause you just might get it and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
cause it might just come back on you ten folllld


i got a letter from a fan that said he's been prayin for me
every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy
cause i don't read every letter i get
but somethin told me to go ahead and open it
but why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
you didn't pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where i'm at i've already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but i've already got god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it
just watchin it from a opposite standpoint man boy's got to look
nuts and that's the only word i can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit


 yeah look

if i would've rap about the crap that's out that's the route
you probably want me to take cause you're just dyin to know what i think
here my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin about paul wall you'd probably crap in your pants
cause i'm white and he's white so he's like
my competition i mean right nope
paul wall is dope and so is bubba so
 b b b b b b but
i don't compete with nobody
i just go hard do the rope a dope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometimes i play possum like i'm asleep it's awesome
i'm like a sleepin giant and when i awake i'm like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite break
and sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
and make a noise like a snake before i kill 'em
and let 'em know that i just don't feel 'em
and smack 'em with the backwards e on the eminem emblem
i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em
tell 'em why look 'em dead in the eye then waste 'em
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it gg goes
one two three chk chk one two three
chk chk one two three that ain't the hook now follow me
there's nothing else for me to say my public adores me
everybody bores me they're just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers "come nearer"


my darling i don't ever want you to leave you're my darling
you and me were meant to be together my darling
and if i cannot have you no one can you're my darling
cause i possess your soul your mind your heart and your body
i don't ever want you to leave you're my darling
you and me were meant to be together my darling
and if i cannot have you no one can you're my darling
cause i possess your soul your mind your heart and your body

  
 ahhhh

you and me were meant to be together my darling
and if i cannot have you no one can you're my darling
cause i possess your soul your mind your heart and your body 
dmc we have a mid 30's male found down unresponsive
possible overdose substance unknown pulse is 60 and thready
respiration's 8 he's intubated and we're baggin' him now
uhh bp: 90 over palp patient is cool pale and diuretic
has aspirated uhh gsc is 3 we'll update en route eta: 10 minutes


as i fall deeper into a manic state
i'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the night well like "i think i'll just have a taste"
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium like "ya that's great"
i go to just take one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach cause i haven't ate
maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
and you'd think that with all i have at stake look at my daughter's face
"mommy something is wrong with dad i think
he's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
and all he does is eat doritos and cheetos
and he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat"


sometimes i feel so alone i just don't know feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold it's like something takes over me as soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like déjà vu i wanna get away from this place i do
but i can't and i won't say i try but i know that's a lie
cause i don't and why i just don't know


maybe just a nice cold brew "what's a beer"
that's the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
and that fucker still talks to me he's all i can fuckin hear
"marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers"
and maybe if i just drink half i'll be half buzzed for half of the time
who's the mastermind behind that little line
with that kind of rationale man i got half a mind
to have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
yeah i know but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch i'm 'bout to fall
i missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncy ball
shit must've knocked me out cause i ain't feel the ground at all
wow what the fuck happened last night where am i
man fuck am i hungover and god damn i
got a headache shit half a vicodin why can't i
"all systems ready for take off please stand by"




so i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh
couple of weeks go by it ain't even like i'm getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya i'm getting by
wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
oh yeah there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
there's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
it's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
what else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am three months later full blown re lapse
"just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax"
and since i'm convinced that i'm an insom niac
i need these pills to be able to sleep so i take three naps
just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
that's an ambien each nap how many valium three
and that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
ok so now ya see the reason how come he
has taken four years to just put out an album b
see me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
cause that christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
it was bologna was it the methadone ya think
or the hydrocordone you hide inside your pornos
your vcr tape cases with you ambien cr great paces to hide 'em ain't it
so you can lie to hailie "i'm going beddy bye whitney baby good night alaina"
go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in an ambulance
they said they found me on the bathroom floor damn


yeah boy
dem better ring the alarm boy

not want to go to sleep
i knock on dakota's door
it's locked so i go to creep
'round the back with binoculars
not 'cause i want to peep
but because i'm hungry
she smells like taco's
i want to eat
visions of hot choclatey marshmallows
also sweet
with sugar plums
oh look here comes marshall he's on your street
he's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on 'em
he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a thanksgiving turkey
a holiday ham
see 'em sprinkled on toast
with strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers
with jon benet rams
i guess a modern day jack the ripper
is all that i am
my music box



cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep 
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me 
and when we're worlds apart you mean the world to me 
if you call i'll come i will answer 
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep 
i hear my music box playing a song for me 
so when she twirls around do a whirl for me 
won't you be my private little dancer 


i almost look comatose
who wants to be sober gross
i foam like a doberman
mouth open i overdose
put coke up my nostrils
in both my holes then i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size
my eyes are so bugged i know
i put on my mother's make up
get naked and run around
waving the gun around
i think i'm down to a hundred pounds
there's thunder i wonder
how come it rains but the sun is out
the devil's upset with his wife
they must be sluggin' it out
i must be buggin' the fuck out
what the fuck i'm 'bout
voices are leading me up to the attic
i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse
the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest
but what do i do it's locked
i pick it and open it
but it's stuffed full of human parts
i dig 'till i find it i wind it up
and the tune it starts
it's playing a song
so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full
i smell a funeral guess i'll loom in the park
my music box


when the lights are off
i see the girls asleep
but i'm waiting my love
keep calling me
we're worlds apart
but you mean the world to me


i'm fixated
on asphyxiating
and breakin' this little chick's neck
like a pixie stick
the sick satan worshippin'
bitches get horse whippin'
i'm in the back
through the back
door slippin'
through the crack
leavin' the corpse drippin'
the mortician of love
sent from above
forced and treat 'em all
when she no more stingy i've become
been doing this for more than a quarter century
i'm just numb
am i dreamin' is it real
someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come
to tie her up
dada roll me the ladder
i've had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window look at her
the crime is slow to shatter
her brain matter and batter her
with a bat a matter of fact
that will splatter her
but before i do that
i'll have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back
like tabitha
i'm your secret admirer
i'm back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight
but you're no match for dracula
prolonging her plight
as i go back to stabbin' her
dismember her limbs
simple as that cadaver her
zoom in with the lens
then pan back the camera
stand back 'cause here comes your man jack
so pamela

big movie star a party girl big fun
she was the girl the media always picked on
in and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months

slowly she gets in and i begin to
lynch her with 66 inches of extension cord




my second victim was even bigger than the first
pop star icon the whole works
she played the little schoolgirl when she first
burst up on the scene it seemed that the world was hers
she twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
it irked me it made me mad at first
i lashed out in my songs 
but what was really goin on was that i had developed a crush
i just didn't know how to tell it to her
should i cut off one of my ears and mail it to her
send her pictures of my collection of skeletons or
footage of me impalin myself on an elephant tusk
we'll settle this once and for all i'ma tell her at dusk
tonight tonight is the night and tell her i must
creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
climb the gate and ring the bell like "hello my love"

skinny ass pants saggin it's only yourself you're playin
call me a clown but you love what the clown's sayin
in them freak shows at the county carnival then you payin
bitch i'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark yellin "go shady"
drivin slower than an old lady
in an old '89 no piece if you pay me
give me peace sign on my grille no mercedes
i'm gettin paid for these shows that i throw lately
same shows a year ago would've broken most of you crazy
they call me crazy cause i made it
bitch you crazy cause you quit look at my clique lady

i'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
patrolling corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action
than rosco beating james tarteenyer 
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood
as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood
that i used as an excuse
and aint shit changed
but kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
shit why not  blow your brain out
i'm blowing mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now

it's only fair to warn
i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
that smashed into your honda accord
with a 4 door ford
but a more toward  droppin an accapella
the choppa  fella
the mozarella
worse than a hellacopta propella
got you locked in the cella
with your skeleton showing
developing anorexia
while i'm standin next to ya
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
with an iv in your veins
feeding you liquid darvicet
pumping you full of drugs
pull the plugs
on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
who were picked up in an ambulance
and driven
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
and given
a less than 20 percent chance
of living
have a possible placement
it's a hospital patient
storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream "i'm still alive"
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
better call the fire department
i've hired a arson
to set fire to carpet
and burn up your entire apartment
i'm a liar to start shit 
got your bitch wrapped around my dick
so tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

met a retarded kid named greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
mixed up with alka seltzer and formula 44d
fuck an acid tab i'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
no more said case closed end of discussion
i'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
cross the bombas 
we blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
and i'm as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus
cause i aint making no more threats
i'm doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
i'm more or less sick in the head
maybe more cause i smoked crack  
today yesterday and the day before sabbath
walk the block with a labrador
strapit more corral for war than el salvador
foul style galore
verbal cow manure
coming together like the eyebrow on al b sure
sometimes i just feel like quittin i still might
why do i put up this fight why do i still write
sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
sometimes i wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
and show these people what my level of skill's like
but i'm still white sometimes i just hate life
somethin ain't right hit the brake lights
case of the stage fright drawin a blank like
da duh duh da da it ain't my fault
great then i falls my insides crawl
and i clam up  i just slam shut
i just can't do it my whole manhood's
just been stripped i have just been vicked
so i must then get off the bus then split
man fuck this shit; yo i'm goin the fuck home
world on my shoulders as i run back to this 8 mile road


i'm a man i'ma make a new plan
time for me to just stand up and travel new land
time to really just take matters into my own hands
once i'm over these tracks man i'ma never look back
 and i'm gone i know right where i'm goin
sorry momma i'm grown i must travel alone
and go follow the footsteps i'm makin my own
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road


i'm walkin these train tracks tryin to regain back
the spirit i had 'fore i go back to the same crap
to the same plant and the same pants
tryin to chase rap gotta move asap
and get a new plan momma's got a new man
poor little baby sister she don't understand
sits in front of the tv buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep runnin from somethin i never wanted so bad
sometimes i get upset cause i ain't blew up yet
it's like i grew up but i ain't grow me two nuts yet
don't gotta rep my step don't got enough pep
the pressure's too much man i'm just tryin to do what's best
and i try sit alone and i cry
yo i won't tell no lie not a moment goes by
that i don't pray to the sky please i'm beggin you god
please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
yo i hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
yo i'm tellin you dawg i'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her kiss baby sister goodbye
say whenever you need me baby i'm never too far
but yo i gotta get out there the only way i know
and i'ma be back for you the second that i blow
on everything i own i'll make it on my own
off to work i go back to this 8 mile road




you gotta live it to feel it you didn't you wouldn't get it
or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is
to be walkin this borderline of detroit city limits
it's different it's a certain significance a certificate
of authenticity you'd never even see
but it's everything to me it's my credibility
you never seen heard smelled or met a real mc
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
but yet i'm still unsigned havin a rough time
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
go to work and serve mc's in the lunchline
but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
who must i show to bust my flow
where must i go who must i know
or am i just another crab in the bucket
cause i ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet i'm startin to doubt shit
i'm feelin a little skeptical who i hang out with
i look like a bum yo my clothes ain't about shit
if the salvation army tryin to salvage an outfit
and it's cold tryin to travel this road
plus i feel like i'm on stuck in this battlin mode
my defenses are so up but one thing i don't want
is pity from no one the city is no fun
there is no sun and it's so dark
sometimes i feel like i'm just bein pulled apart
from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends
it's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not
what i'm doin i just blow my head is a stove top
i just explode the kettle gets so hot
sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that i don't got
but i've learned it's time for me to u turn
yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
ain't no fallin no next time i meet a new girl
i can no longer play stupid or be immature
i got every ingredient all i need is the courage
like i already got the beat all i need is the words
got the urge suddenly it's a surge
suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
i am no longer scared now i'm free as a bird
then i turn and cross over the median curb
hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road


hi
original bad boy on the case cover your face
came in the place blowed and sprayed puffy with mase
i laced the weed with insect repellant better check the smelly
eminem starts with e better check the spelling
with a capital somebody grab me a snapple
i got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple 
somebody dropped me on my head and i was sure
that my mother did it but the bitch won't admit it was her
i slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said "i'm ready now bitch   ain't you feelin these kicks cunt"
the world ain't ready for me yet i can tell
i'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
i'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs
and i'm hotter than my dick is when i piss and it burns
i kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it 
  hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
if y'all don't like me you can suck my dick til you numb it
and all that gibberish you was spittin you need to kill it
cause your style is like dyin in my sleep i don't feel it

chorus: eminem

cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me  ha
is fuckin crazy    hello hi
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    do you hear me
is fuckin crazy


i'm ice grillin you starin you down with a gremlin grin
i'm eminem you're a fag in a women's gym
i'm slim the shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case i get chased by space aliens
a brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
than a maniac saudi arabian
a highly combustible head spazmatic
strapped to a kraftmatic adjustable bed
laid up in the hospital in critical condition
i flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
high speed iv full of thai weed
lookin chinese with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins joined at the groin like lesbians
uhh pins and needles hypodermic needles and pins
i hope god forgives me for my sins    it probably all depends
on if i keep on killin my girlfriends

chorus: eminem

cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me  ha
is fuckin crazy    listen
cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me
is fuckin crazy


last night i od'd on rush mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
  i'm an alcoholic and that's all i can say
i call in to work cause all i do is frolic and play
i swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
of tylenol 3 and talk about how violent i'll be 
give me eleven excederin my head'll spin
medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
scratched my balls til i shredded skin
"doctor check this rash look how red it's been"
"it's probably aids"  forget it then
i strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense like dykes usin dildos
so reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
and pick up this slim shady shit that's on rawkus
somethin somethin somethin somethin i get weeded
my daughter scribbled over that rhyme i couldn't read it
damn
all you see is the sun reflectin off of the gun
i'm ready for the showdown that go down at one
sweat on my brow let's settle it now
i'ma show you how real cowboys get down
i'm polishin gold waitin for this drama to unfold
i got a  rolled
feelin bold gangsters blood runs cold
it's time to reload this old 45 colt
the wind's gusty it's hot muggy and dusty
bust a couple shots make sure i'm not rusty
it's passed noon he should be here soon
sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs
sounds like a thousand wolves
i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze
i pose like a poster he's closer than close
i hold the heat sturdy i heard he fight's dirty
but i'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
and just when i went to fill him with hot lead
i put the gun to his head and this is what he said


you never met me and you'll probably never see me again
but i know you   the name's slim   you want revenge
then don't shoot i'm in the same boots as you
i'm tellin the truth i got a price on my head too cause when you

chorus: 

you ride like a cowboy toward the sun
and life ain't fun when you're on the run
got your gold and you got your gun
but life as an outlaw just begun
got your shotgun by your side
got your horse and you got your pride
you ride til there ain't no place to hide
it's sad cause the bad guys always die

  
he was "shady" i seen by the look on his face
he said take ten paces  i took eight
spun around and i aimed straight for the brain
my  went bang but it only fired a blank he said
   
i put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
we both drew at the same time and stood stunned
  
i figured he was tellin the truth that's why i didn't shoot
so what we gon' do it's on you
  
the chronic
  
  
who
  
loaded up my saddle got ready for battle
hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle 
we rolled two miles until we hit the spot
an old ghost town that everybody forgot
a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
slim grabbed the shotgun 


this is the spot they call him doc loveless
he's goin around sayin he took the game from us
  
but he ain't got no legs they cut 'em off at the stomach
he's got mechanical legs he spins webs
plus he's well respected by the hip hop heads
our mission   is to get him to stop layin eggs
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps


i drew two guns spun them on my fingers
kicked the swingin doors in started gun slinging
i could hear somebody singin   it sounded like a "g thang"
and a verse from "keep their heads ringin"
i said "it's dre's day" and started to spray
against 1800 he pulls a ak
hollow tips started flyin every which way


that's when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i fired the first shot spun his body around
he hit the ground and landed upside down
dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold
i grabbed two girlies and a  that's rolled

chorus 2x

  always die
  the wild gotham
  the wild west 
  ha ha riiiiide
yeah shady

does it make you mad when i switch my flow
you can't understand how i get my dough
50 cent i'm on fire 'cause shady said so
 i'm on fire


everybody's in a rush to try and get the throne
i just get on the track and try to set the tone
i ain't tryna use nobody as a stepping stone
but don't compare me i'm better off just left alone
and i ain't even tryna go there with record sales
i'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
say what up keep stepping and just rep d 12
keep my nose clean and stay away from weapons jail
and living reckless but if you gon' check my belt
you may see something else i use to protect myself
a vest to stop a ruger and deflect its shells
and send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
and i don't even carry guns no more i don't got to
got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
and i den seen a lotta people cross the line
but this motherfucker ja must have lost his mind
that ex got him thinking he was dmx
then he switched to pac now he's tryna be him next
so which one are you x luther pac or michael
just keep singing the same song recycled
we all much rather get along than fight you
me and halie dance to ya songs we like you
and you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
come on now you know the white boy will bite you
i hurt ya pride dog and you know i don't like to
but i will if i have to wit syllable after
syllable i'll just slap ya killin you faster
then you popin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
that shit you're on but if you want it you got it
you'd bump this shit too if we ain't diss you on it
but if we lock horns we could charge harder than busta
we bump heads wit any motherfucka that wants ta
so what's the deal what's with all the tough talk
when i walked up to you like "ja what up dog"
how come you didn't say you had a problem then
when you were standing there with all ya men
we could have solved it then i'm a grown man dog come holla
all you did was laugh then smile and swallow
another one of those little ex pills in front of me
and tell me 50 cent was everything that you wanna be come on


i know you don't want it wit me
you know you don't want it wit me

teats and thurston howell and yelling wordsworth
my mother smoked crack i had a premature birth
i'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves
you wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99% of aliens prefer earth
come here to rule the planet storm on your turf
i hid a secret message inside of a word search
with smeared letters runnin together and blurs spurts
hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
i point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
been a bad boy since diapers and gerbers
my first words were bleep bleep and curse curse
never had shit and i still don't deserve dirt
my breath still stinks and i'm on my third cert
digging out my stitches and hollering nurse nurse
you said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse

a mess of warrants you want some come and get some boys
i'm givin daniel pantaleo a refresher course
on excessive force and pressure points
and dressin george zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bull's eye on his back his whole chest and torso

if i was president gettin off is
the first order of business once i get in office

naked laughing dick cupped in hand
screamin "fuck safe sex"
throw a latex and an aids test at him
tell congress i run this land
and i want the rubber banned   and make it snappy
addiction to friction and static addict who can't escape the habit

with a gauge to blast it and sped away in the station wagon
stacey dash's and casey anthony's crazy asses
in the back seat throwin stayfree pads at me
dead passenger in the passenger seat unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic
so hard i snapped the relocation brackets
for the monster tires finna get a murder case and catch it

couldn't be more awkwarder cause your innocence i robbed you of
it's my fingers that got stuck up
taught ya ta not give a slapstick hockey puck
the broad hunter with the sawed off like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
but i'm not gonna get the shotgun or glock i'ma opt for the ox
cause i'm into objects that are sharp when i shop
and it's not a shock i'm such an obnoxious fucker
the rock hudson of rock cause who woulda thought this much of a cocksucker
to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with the box cutter
 that was for 50
little slap on the wrist be warned i'm unravelin quickly
my squabbles i'm grappling with your time travelling with me
try and follow as i wobble   relapse into history
with a flask of the whiskey tip it back then i'm twisting wine bottles
like what happened to chris reeve's spine column
that's the plan of attack when i'm fixing my problems
wish my chest wasn't havin to get these rhymes off 'em
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i haven't come back on these faggots who diss me
is more of a spectacular mystery than a fuckin agatha christie crime novel

but my patience is wearing thin
swear i been contemplatin rubbin shit in your face 'til i smear it in
diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again if you actually had fuckin careers to end
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer 'em
in that direction and forget my ideas for them
molly i'm gone off you man light some kush
you're my first take i'll nail you can't lie i gush
if i won you over you would be the grand prize i'm entranced by your looks
come and give the shady franchise a push
you can get it in the can like some anheuser busch
jeans too small least three pant sizes tush
mushed against your damn side your puss and thighs are squished
what kind of attire's that i'm ready to be rode psychopath
bet you we'll/wheel get it poppin like a flat
light the match to ignite the wrath
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
piper chapmans might just have to pick et me like a scab
hard to describe in fact startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and you aren't really surprised at that but as far as these lines i rap
and these bars wouldn't dial it back if i star 69'ed the track

why am i such a dick
this motherfucker man
just won't shut up will you
talking 'bout i owe him
bitch you owe me i'm promoting you right now
yo let's put the nail in his coffin


i don't wanna be like this
i don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but i'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap 
and old men have heart attacks
and i don't wanna be responsible for that so
put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignitay


i would never claim to be no ray benzino
an eighty three year old fake pacino
so how can he hold me over some balcony without
blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me 
please don't you'll probably fall with me and our asses'll both be history
but then again you'd finally get your wish
cause you'll be all over the street like 50 cent 
fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump

tryin to jump the ruff ryderz and they cut you up
and you put jada on a track that's how much you suck dick

you sit behind a fuckin desk at the source butt kissin'
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearances
and you can't even get the clearances 'cuz real lyricists
don't even respect you or take you serious
it's not that we don't like you we hate you period

where you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin'
pressing up your own flyers and your stickers stickin'
them bitches up after spending six hours at kinko's
just making copies of your covers to cassette singles
to sell them out of the trunk of your tracer
spending your whole paychecks at disk makers
what you know about being bullied over half your life

desperados with the cars eminem


chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln

broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
i'ma go for your mids here's a body blow for your ribs
while you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
i know where you live your girl showed me your crib
unless she told me a fib then i'ma have both of ya did
burning incense facing a murder sentence
under intense investigation for killing infants
while i sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jabbed in they wombs
slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
sticking it far with drugs and jumping in garbage trucks
i'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch
see me every summer laying up against the dumpster
with a hundred dollar jumper smothered in southern comfort
got my slim shady sticker on your mother's bumper
she came home screaming a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

twist 'em like beer caps once they hear that
rap murder rates and i snap vertebrates

your pack deserve a crate in fact the word is fate
i kill you slow like aids infested nuts
i'm holding vendetta like seven great molested sluts
calling me a bitch nigga you need to stop
reality one on one how many times you got dropped
i'm cutthroat when any track runs conscious when i smack nuns
the rough method make muslims run and pack guns
i'm volcanic the sermon preacher
burning emcees most wanted by herman kiefer
you tried to get a squad they was like "money oh no"
leave you brain dead hitting trees with sonny bono
i kick without a dojo d12 slow flow
shoot down your mothership and pimp smack mojo
no pro wanna go knuckle blades with the renegade
nigga tried to go pop and plus they minute made
my lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
big p the reason emcees cancelled they show
the truth will hurt seeing proof at work no shame in it
the best part of your show is when you put my name in it
my squad be godly fearing shit hardly
so i hope when i'ma die dope like chris farley

yo' bitch paid my bill that's where the hell yo' rent went

i kill competition with no way out as an opposition
execute the passengers on the flight my executive decision
then reminisce on how shady the business
terrorists asked by iraelis when they visit
bombing incentive world war three in the making
murdered the exhibition team finish~ beat the ref senseless~
no timeout extended play burns over your intermission
then christen the battlefield with the blood of christians
crying for the messiah but he don't listen
i pop my wig when i top the stove frame boil sizzling
a pyromaniac cook i do damage to kitchens
fuck home depot i demolition
when i home improve you need bob here to fix it
fuck school and supervision
bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
and pistol grip punks for the beefing do you wanna get heated


i got a mind full of troubles everything's in doubles
i buy my guns in couples no time for placement fumbles
cause emcees come and emcees go with broke flow
injured from head to toe no fitter model we full throttle
you stuck in low incapable to master flow
everything is tactical living mathematical
i smash the flow unleash and let go
i shit like lava original designer
married to marijuana since a minor
making attempts to sink my battleship could get you bent like fibs what
applying death defying feats maintain to keep my peace
flow like the sea when i release these beats over concrete


my presidented transition has taken place
as i express vocally on the m i c r o
power he's cipher not equality i deal it
lace the track and made it real now i know my people feel it

plus i'm precise and my double edge continue slicing

cause i'm as despicable as daffy duck when i'm spittin
ha ha "recovery"
they ask me am i okay they ask me if i'm happy
are they askin me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care
doody most of my life it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say "i love you" as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now but somehow i know you're near me
your presence; oh i went and dropped some presents off for easter
to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little and dawg you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now jesus
and everyone else is just tryin to pick up the pieces
man how could you touch so many fuckin lives and just leave us
they say grievance has its way of affectin everyone different
if it's true how the fuck i'm 'sposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds


yo yeah
doody   that's what we called each other
i don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees i was catchin a sunburn
tryin to walk under the trees just to get me some comfort
i'm moanin i just wanna get home and i look over
and your shirt is off i'm like "you're gonna fry"; you're like "no i won't i'm
black stupid and black people they got melatonin
in their skin we don't burn" meanwhile my face is glowin
and i feel like i'm on fire and the entire time you're just laughin at me
and snappin at me with your shirt bastard
and i have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well nate finally got 'em back shit
that musta been at least 16 years ago well i put 'em in your cask oww
movin past it it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city motown hip hop vet
hip hop shop dreads it don't stop there
yeah as difficult as it sounds


yeah and this may sound a little strange but i'ma tell it
i found a jacket that you left at my wedding i picked it to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass and
hang it up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all of me and d12 we feel like "fuck rap"
it feels like our general just fuckin died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers all our cell numbers is changed our two ways
are in the trash so some cats'll have to find a new way
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
purple gang you gotta keep pressin on
don't ever give up the dream dawg i got love for you all
and doody it's true you brought people together 
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peace maker doody i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin
if it had to happen it had to happen   believe me
i know you're the one who taught me to throw dem 'bows back on dresden
from eggin cars to paintballin gettin arrested
to sittin across from each other in cells laughin and jestin
they tried to hit us for five years for that no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality left sweatin
me you and   what's his face i forgot his fuckin name
shame he even came to your funeral he betrayed 
our team and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin face
and that's on hailie jade whitney lane and alaina's name
i'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you and pour some liquor out
with obie in the parkin lot of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds
dre just let it run
ay yo turn the beat up a little bit
ay yo this sing is for anyone fuck it
just shut up and listen
ay yo


i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensing these sentences
getting this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eating or feeding my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me
i don't know you and no
i don't owe you a motherfucking thing
i'm not mr nsync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm lifting you 10 feet lifting you 10 feet in the air
i don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you of all you
i don't mean to be mean but that's all i can be it's just me

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
i don't know it's just the way i am


sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and "oh it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me
so i point one back at 'em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn  and the heroin
where were the parents at  and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upper class city
havin this happeninthis happenin
then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way
but i'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and it's burnin and i have returned


and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
radio won't even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
i don't know it's just the way i am


i'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on "my name is"
and pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rock & roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin
the same fucking questions fucking questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
till i'm grabbin my hair and i'm tearin it out
cause they driving me crazy driving me crazy i can't take it
i'm racing i'm pacing i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad

 
and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
radio won't even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't then why would i say i am
in the paper the news everyday i am
i don't know it's just the way i am

:
yo
at birth i was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
the first time i went to stick it up the shit hurt
mom wouldn't take me
the bitch still hates me
shit one day she said "go rake leaves" 
i said "make me"
i'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid
who was kicked out of his house 
for making fart sounds with his mouth
arguing with me and mom was on going
she called law enforcement when i broke the law mower
the slut gave me a truck when i turned sixteen
i went to start it and it screamed "please fix me"
back then when will smith was still the fresh prince
and him and jeff were still best friends i guess then
i decided to cut class to rap full time
and get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
come and see me see if i don't live up to this image
you fuckin' pricks

scratching:

"noyou hear me you go to hell"  > mr garrison

verse two :

niggas scared of the firm
slim dirty dozen and trice
come back like thieves in the night
niggas jump that's reason to fight
that's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
motherfucker

trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
then i get manic depressed see the orthodontist get gassed; man it's kick ass
the first thing i put on is the mask

speaking of masks man it ain't too late to have a change of pace
and take it off and show my face so you can see the things you face
and slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
that's bacon souffle you making ain't you
well thank you jason
there goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
just give me one more soma and i'll be done for mama

shoving the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet

whose it belong to maybe the girl with the long blond
hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
clearly there's som'n wrong 'cause she didn't come home
she's missing; where is she something fishy is going on
i guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
now everybody get your dance on to my damn song

c'mon

people say that i'm a bad influence
i say the world's already fucked i'm just addin to it
they say i'm suicidal teenagers' newest idol 
c'mon do as i do go ahead get mad and do it

c'mon do as i do go ahead get mad and do it



hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space 
i'ma sit on top of the world  and shit on brandy and mase
i'm more than ill
i'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill 
human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot and people that feel me
cause i'ma still be madd rapper whether i got money or not 
as long as i'm on pills and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddlin makin fun of your yacht
but i would like an award 
for the best rapper to get one mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might get sent up back strike in a ford
and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadin for
everybody's pissin' me off; even the no limit tank 
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
no shit i'm a great danger to my health 
why else would i kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself

they say i'm suicidal teenagers' newest idol 
c'mon do as i do go ahead get mad and do it



i'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action than roscoe beatin james todd sr
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
and ain't shit changed i kept the same mindstate
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence i just encourage it 
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps 
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
shit why not blow your brain out i'm blowin mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now



people say that i'm a bad influence
i say the world's already fucked i'm just addin to it
they say i'm suicidal teenagers' newest idol 
c'mon do as i do go ahead get mad and do it

my laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
make you satanistic make you take the pistol to your face 
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out 
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
i'm not a "role model" i don't wanna babysit kids
i got one little girl and hailey jade is shady's business
and shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
where the fuck were you when gil was paid to make me dishwash
i make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
you made me get a bigger attitude than eighty kim scott's
and she almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
i knew that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
and "just the two of us" that ain't got shit to do with us 
and our personal life it's just words on a mic
so you can call me a punk a pervert or a chauvinist pig
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch


the invasion 
green lantern the infiltration we comin' 


i got 50 cent i got g unit
d tweezy in this bitch wit obie trice
so watch what you say 'fore you call our name
cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice

i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
sooner or later you little haters
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it g unit made it and obie's coming
d tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
the other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
but if you even considerin' taking our label down
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
but i ain't trying to get too intricate into it
i'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
cause then it's gonna get to the point
where it escalates to some other shit
then i'm a flip then i'm a get to
"stomping in my air force ones"
but you won't be able to tell 
if it's two pairs or it's one
it's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
you'd think nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
i don't know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me
thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
y'all tickle me pink 
i think i'd just rather have pink tickle me
hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety
a little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
mixed with a little bit of the 
wit a pinch of biggie
look at me i'm just the bomb diggedy

cause i'm off probation in less than six months 


haha shady records
still aftermath and don't think we don't 
hear you motherfuckers talkin'
cause we do and we see y'all
we just gon' sit back for a minute 
while i see what the fuck y'all do
here to stay
even when i'm gone
when i close my eyes
through the passage of time
kings never die


i can hear the drummer drummin and the trumpets someone's
tryna summon someone i know somethin's comin but i'm runnin from it
to be standin at the summit and plummet how come it wasn't what i thought it was was it
too good to be true have nothin get it all but too much of it
then lose it again then i swallow hallucinogens
cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifer's den
by the dutch oven just choosin to sin
even if it means i'm sellin my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win
cause i got this muh'fuckin cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it
cracks in it bet you morons didn't think i'd be back did ya
how 'bout that i'm somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that
i bark this sport is somethin i never bow wow'd at
i complain about the game i shout and i pout
it's a love hate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt
even when you bitches are countin me out and i appear to be down for the count
only time i ever been out and about is drivin around town with my fuckin whereabouts in a doubt
cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but i'm not a quitter
gotta get up give it all i got or give up
spit or shit or stepped on but kept goin
i'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong
cause you're movin onto the next but is your respect gone
cause someone told me that


kings never die


don't give me that sob story liar don't preach to the choir
you ain't never even had to reach in the fire
to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer
wouldn't even take shit into consideration
obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features
and try to show out on a track with me   but it'd actually
have to be a fuckin blowout to get me to retire
tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age
fuck a twitter page did it just say i've been upstaged
why am i online it's drivin me crazy i'm ridin shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot but i'm not gonna conform better stay
passin this shit and opinions sway i can hear 'em say
if i stay passionate maybe i can stay jay miraculous come back as if i went away
but detractors just say some bullshit for the renegade
someone's gonna make me blow my composure here i go again to the stage
and i feel like i'm in a cage   they so want a champion to fall
i still wonder why i laugh at 'em cause why carry when i'm all so   fuck what these cynics say
it just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
and i'm under attack again that i'll act as if i'm posted up with this pent up rage
cause   cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door
all be just metaphors for the odds of when you comin back again cause all
the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just don't mean jack anymore
cause i'm here today and gone tomorrow
and i'm not gonna be




i want it i'm comin to get it so you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get riddled full
critics all end up in critical think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
and i ain't stoppin 'til i'm on top again all alone and on a throne
like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode i've been on
tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard i broke my collarbone
and when it's my time to go i'm still not leaving
stop for no one i don't know but i've been told a obstacle that
blocks your road to knock it over time to go for that pot of gold cause
they say kings never die just ask jam master jay
they just grow wings and they fly; so hands up reach for the sky
try to hold up and provoke these moments
cause in the blink of an eye they'll be overrrr
tryna secure your legacy like shakur and ensure
that nobody's ever gonna be what you were so before you're leavin this earth
you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berzerk
deacon of words syllable genius at work plus i'm thinkin that they're
mistakin my kindness for weakness distill it with meanness
i went from powdered milk and purina to flippin burgers on the grill for some peanuts
from gilbert's to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers
i made it to the silver screen where rocky stepped with the demons khalil on the beat cause
makin the beat ain't the same feelin to me is killin the beat it's overfillin to me it's what fillin a seat is
that sound vomit thirst and how common underground commons eat
outsider stomach growl throbbin hunger out rhymin everyone god just give me
one shot i swear that i won't let you down
i'ma be around forever entertainin even in the ground
you ain't never ever gonna hear me say i ain't




oh oh oh oh oh oh oooooh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oooooh
oh oh
kings never die
i'll leave your blueprints covered in shoe prints
poppin' nuprin
neighborhood nuisance
murder your family for two cent
makin' your crew tense
brain's too dense
leave the mic with two dents
fresher than a whole mouth full of chewed mints
givin' you rude hints
cause if you're wack i'm gonna tell ya
i got the issue where they diss in next month's source i'm gonna mail ya
you're a failure
you're style's staler than a bowl of hardened rice
scared and sliced
i flunked kinder garden twice
but you ain't hard and nice
and you sure ain't servin' no bids
sayin' you did is like seein' a damn virgin with kids
creepin' like a phantom
holdin' my dick like the player's anthem
holdin' this microphone for ransom
bitches ask me why do i talk nasty
grab an ass of every trashy whore that walks past me
my crew's on drugs lookin' like zombies
smokin' bomb trees
racin' police and dodge 


lock cock and explode
way beyond bitin' a nigga
get hungry disconnect my jaw and swallow you whole
i'm probably gonna blow
go to hell holdin' a mil
street smart under educated over skilled
i'm tight to the vest
you wanna rip me off then try
i fight to the death who wanna piss me off then die
curse niggas that try i'm the first nigga to bust
you the second nigga to pull and the first nigga to die
how dare you think that you gleam like the rest of my team
you a bitch you like a chip off a berget in my ring
stick to my words so i don't threaten niggas no more
if i make you a promise then it's safe to say that it's honest
my guns is tired from being fired
while yours sits on the shelf
i'm like a song concept in itself
totin' my weapon burnin' your vest
in '99 wack niggas learn from the best and hope to be second
nigga
kool kid nigga
what
left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands here's yo' lifespan
and for what yo' life's worth this money is twice than
grab a couple grand and lamp in iceland
see i'm a nice man but money turned me to satan
i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin
hurry up with the cash bitch i got a ride waitin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
i want the whole pie i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and $200 ain't enough to water the seed
the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell and hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried escapin the jack
grabbed her by the throat it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
but i slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin "freeze"
but i'm already wanted for sellin ki's
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit me square in the chest wasn't wearin a vest
left the house pullin out the drive backin out
blew the back end out this lady's jag started blackin out
pulled the mac 10 out stuck it in her face
shut your yackin mouth 'fore i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair smacked her up
thinkin fuck it mug her while you're there jacked her up
stole her car made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl in "set it off" did
jetted off kid stole the whip now i'm a criminal
drove it through somebody's yard dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin: "johnny go in and call the police
tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80 year old lady with groceries
there goes cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped must a been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i musta dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin "truce truce"
and surrendered my weapon to cops
wasn't me  it was the gangster rap and the peppermint schnapps

chorus

chorus 
hi kids  do you like violence  
wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids  
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did  
try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is  
my brain's dead weight i'm tryin to get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to impregnate  
and dr dre said "slim shady you a basehead"
uh uhhh  "so why's your face red  man you wasted"
well since age twelve i've felt like i'm someone else
cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
c'mere slut  
i don't give a fuck god sent me to piss the world off

chorus


my english teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
the only problem was my english teacher was a guy
i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper  
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup  
extraterrestrial killin pedestrians
rapin lesbians while they screamin: "let's just be friends"
ninety nine percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin usher fans  
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph  
so i signed it: 'dear dave thanks for the support asshole'

chorus


stop the tape  this kid needs to be locked away  
dr dre don't just stand there operate
i'm not ready to leave it's too scary to die
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
am i comin or goin  i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka    dare me to drive  
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk  
i spit when i talk i'll fuck anything that walks  
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom    you ain't got no tits  
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  
i'm steamin mad   
and by the way when you see my dad  
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had

chorus eminem as susan 
 eminem as dave
 eminem as john
 eminem as ron

chorus: repeat 2x

i never meant to give you mushrooms girl
i never meant to bring you to my world
now you sitting in the corner crying
and now it's my fault my fault


i went to john's rave with ron and dave
and met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
a nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
susan    an ex manic depressive who just moved from houston
who love booze and alternative music 
told me she was starvin i said it wasn't a problem 
i got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
we can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage
 i'm allergic to fungus 
come on sue that's nonsense

wanna copy me and do exactly like i did
try  and get messed up worse that my life is
my brain's dead weight i'm tryin to get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to 
and dr dre said "slim shady you a basehead"
uh uhhh  "so why's your face red  man you wasted"
well since age twelve i've felt like a caged elf
who stayed to himself in one space chasin his tail 
got ticked off and ripped pamela lee's lips off
kissed em and said "i ain't know silicone was 'sposed to be this soft"
i'm bout to pass out and crash and fall in the grass
faster than a fat man who sat down too fast
c'mere lady  
i don't give a damn dre sent me to tick the world off

chorus


my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high  
thanks a lot next semester i'll be thirty five
i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and told him to change the grade on the paper  
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
served the bartender then walked out with a tip cup
extraterrestrial runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they're screamin at me: "let's just be friends"
ninety nine percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more  than i do
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin  and name it after her  
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin usher fans  
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph  
so i signed it: 'dear dave thanks for the support '

chorus


stop the tape  this kid needs to be locked away  
dr dre don't just stand there operate
i'm not ready to leave it's too scary to die
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
am i comin or goin  i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of kool aid    dare me to drive  
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
clothes ripped like the incredible hulk  
i spit when i talk i'll  anything that walks  
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom    you ain't got no   
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head  
i'm steamin mad   
and by the way when you see my dad  
ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad

chorus  
i am phenomenal 
with every ounce of my blood with every breath in my lungs
won't stop until i'm pheno menal
i am phenomenal 
however long that it takes i'll go to whatever lengths
it's gonna make me a monster though
i am phenomenal 
but i'll never say 
cause i'm gonna be
phenomenal 


unstoppable unpoppable thought bubbles
untoppable thoughts fuckin juggernaut that'll
stomp you in a verse
obstacles i'm drawn to 'em when the going got rough
show 'em what i done thought that was the worse
lil' sissy who the fuck taught you how to per 
 severe there ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
the messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
yeah i don't try like hell but i might as well hang it up like a shelf
gotta keep growin with it evolve
cause you can keep throwin shit at the wall
but you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
time to slip in that zone 'til i find myself
inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
in the waters where nobody else has gone before
or willin to go uncharted feelin is so
bomb i'm feelin myself i'm a giant
sometimes i gotta remind myself that




let me self empower you
when you're down and they're tryin to clown the fuck out of you
when you feel like you're runnin out of fuel
i'll show you how to use doubt as fuel convert it to gunpowder too
now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
put a spark to it like martha stewart barbecuing
aww screw it feel like you wanna hit that wall then do it
punch through it just cock back put your all into it
now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
never take back what you say
if you stay strapped in your brain engage in this steel cage match
ready to scrap asap
take your fists to his bones show who's big and who's smallest
you're christopher wallace yeah i picture 'em all as
plastic and foam and it lays flat where you put your dinner plates at
and set it on it like a placemat
 and i want you to say that




step into the unknown
and find yourself your glory
free the ignoring person


got a fuckin mouth with no shut off valve
can't even cut a power to it but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin ground cause i worked my butt off now
it's a subject that i don't know how to shut up about
cause i stuck it out
like a motherfuckin tongue that's how i responded when i got shoved around
you're gonna have non believers
but when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how
get it how you live
but are you prepared to give more than you get
and put in twice what you get back from this shit
though what you sacrifice barely is half never give rap is my shiv
but it's like my shield at the same time i wield
i'ma knife this will sometimes i feel just like b real from cypress hill
how i can just kill a cypher survivor's guilt
i rhyme like life is still
an uphill climb ready to face it each challenge waitin
can taste it it's salivation i'm wagin retaliation
look what i have built reputation is validation
the only thing i'm capable of makin is amazing
only thing you're capable of makin is a false statement
an accusation   i'm legendary status
in fact that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
your legend is makin an allegation
i write with the left
same hand i hold the mic with as i fight to the death
'til my last breath managed
to prove who the best man is prevailin
all cards be the only one left standin
in the end but i ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowin what it's like to be southpaw
cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
cause


yo i dedicate to this to yo


to all my fans keepin y'all in health
let's tell this whitey ford to go fuck himself
cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin

peckerwood mad cause his record went wood

and said "heck country western rap records are good"
so he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
he can't rap or sing but he wants to do both 
puts an album out and rules for part of the year
then kid rock and limp bizkit come from out of nowhere

and fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew

some days i just wanna up and call it quits
i feel like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
every time i go to get up i just fall in pits
my life's like one great big ball of shit
if i could just put it all into all i spit
instead of always tryin to swallow it
instead of starin at this wall and shit
while i sit writer's block sick of all this shit
can't call it shit
all i know is i'm about to hit the wall
if i have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits
this is it last straw that's all that's it
i ain't dealin with another fuckin politic
i'm like a skillet bubblin until it filters up
i'm about to kill it i can feel it buildin up
blow this building up i've concealed enough
my cup runneth over i done filled it up
the pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts
you think all i do is stand here and feel my nuts
well i'ma show you what you gon' feel my rush
you don't feel it then it must be too real to touch
peal the dutch i'm about to tear shit up
goosebumps yea i'ma make your hair sit up
yea sit up i'ma tell you who i be
i'ma make you hate me cause you ain't me
you wait it ain't too late to finally see
what you closed minded fucks were too blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world ain't no one out there mind as me
you need piece of mind here's a piece of mine
all i need's a line
but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how i'm really feelin at that time
yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
it's just sometimes it's always me
how dark can these hallways be
the clock strikes midnight one two then half past three
this half assed rhyme with this half assed piece of paper
 i'm desperate at my desk
if i can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
stuck in a slump can't think of nothin
fuck i'm stumped but wait here comes somethin
 nope it's not good enough scribble it out
new pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out
i'm fizzlin now thought i figured it out
ball's in my court but i'm scared to dribble it out
i'm afraid but why am i afraid
why am i a slave to this trade
signed out of spit to the grave
real enough to rile you up
want me to flip it i can rip it any style you want
i'm a switch hitter bitch jimmy smits ain't a quitter
i'ma sit until i get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin boilin point put some oil in your joints
flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
an mc's worst dream i make 'em tense
they hate me see me and shake like a chainlink fence
by the looks of 'em you would swear their jaws was comin
by the screams of 'em you would swear i'm sawin someone
by the way they're runnin you would swear the law was comin
it's now or never and tonight is all or nothin
momma jimmy keeps leavin on us he said he'd be back
he pinky promised i don't think he's honest
i'll be back baby i just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock i'ma make 'em eat this watch
don't believe me watch i'ma win this race
and i'ma come back and rub my shit in your face bitch
i found my nitch you gon' hear my voice
'til you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice
if i gotta scream 'til i have half a lung
if i had half a chance i'd grab it   rabbit run
cause i remember all those years
how it was when you were here
i remember how it was how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago 
kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

i remember back when you had the knack 
and i remember when you had your first heart attack 
i was right there laughin when i heard the news 
i just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you 
 maybe ice t's right you are a bitch 

you come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich

but the dumbest thing that you could ever do 
was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do 



yo  yo  yo 
remember back in '94 like right before ms everlast was whitey ford
before his heart attack had him on life support
when house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
and they became destined to never jump around again
or even further back when i first had heard the knack
and you were down with syndicate i went to get your shit man
i was into it
but then you went and took your style and switched the shit
now you sound rediculous you dickless piece of shit
how could you diss me bitch
i liked you thought you was alright for a white dude
remember sway and tech when i came up and sat beside you
started rhymin then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin
like you was mad that someone else was
white and tried to rhyme or somethin
i'm sorry man i wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
but you're a homosexual white rappin irish 
man i wish i was irish i could be a  too
then i'd be confused as you and i wouldn't know what to do
what's up with you 
i never fucked with you why would you fuck with me
knowin i could rap circles around you what are you as nuts as me
plus i can sing better than you and i don't fuckin sing
and probably play guitar better and i ain't never touched a string
but i ain't mad at you i'd hate me too if i was you
i'm what you used to be shit you was me in '92
so everytime i write a lyric i'mma think of you
and maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

x2

you fuckin punk pussy you fuckin faggot sissy fuck
and by the way a 380's a fuckin sissy gun

i ain't no politician but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits i'll wear it
but if it don't then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference   they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict   like you didn't experiment
now now that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin do gooders   too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go   he's royce he's the king of detroit

jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatter brained atheist
but that ain't the case see it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter   a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today

while i'm wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me

when the unsigned hype column in the source was like
our only source of light
when the mics used to mean something a four was like
you were the shit now it's like the least you get
three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
four and a half or five

i spoon feed 'em the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
who believe they makin it rain cause all they see is the clouds
and i watch from the couch of the vip like a potato
with a bunch of meatheads like  it i'll just feed 'em a cow
plenty of white boys to pick from this year
but before you pick a pepper you better pick up your heater
cause even peter piper could pick up a mic
but what's like to pick a fight with me is like puttin nikes on a cheetah
better speed up or at least in my case adidas
i'm out this bitch drinkin sprite by the 2 liter
holler shady records 

 nah i need the scratch to get me amped
 aiyyo wait wait wait wait wait wait okay go yeah yeah
 i'm 'bout to get 'em i'm 'bout to get 'em right
 wait wait okay


yo say i'm from the new school i'ma say check your tone and watch your mouth
if they teachin how to dougie i'm condonin droppin out
forced a while   y'all birthed me and gave me up
i just perfected bein hip hop's foster child
now check it don't blame y'all for bein trash fans are coppin it
the radios the crime scene the masses are the hostages
in my youth i'd throw shots the fag was dodgin it
i'm grown i ain't watchin the throne i'm sabotagin it
you see that four headed monster in the storm loom
snipe 'em from a distance the scope got a long zoom
you super mario thugs is in the wrong room
gotta figure here you won't get bigger if you on 'shrooms
was left to me i'd revive what the game be 'bout
i'da took the wine outta amy 'house
enough raps from you scrub cats 'bout cockin a snub back
wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
but i got this shit from uptown she my summer bunny
both parents broke but she come/cum from money
think my bread is her paper to burn
so i lock her out and now she doubt david is stern
she's so bad i make her hit the telly from a taxi
then dead her in that holiday inn learned that from max b
that's why the haters every kind'll wanna send me llamas
i made it right before they eyes like i was benihana's
is it me or is what i'm hearin is pitiful
airwaves the same now the stereo's typical
my skin thick so the critics ignored
so unafraid to die you'd think i did it before
the boy's rodman with the trash talk magic or ward
with the black ball way i bounce off the ass forward would cap whores
blast y'all hoodie and mask will be the black foot with no passport
body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors
if punks had awards your status whore is categor'
probably be that of awards 'tween michael rapaport or kenny lattimore
i know hip hop's alive and well
if it died you other crews wouldn't survive the smell

 ladies and gentlemen
 you scared now
 make that face at 'em dawg
 crooked i get 'em


i spot a victim the plot'll thicken when the clock is tickin
i caught him slippin i gotta give him a shot i hit him
with proper spittin hottest writtens in composition
so competition's a contradiction somebody mention
they got it crooked highly fiction we probably different
got gotti henchmen opposition i body quick as bugatti engines
i'm on a mission to get richer
the sickest lyric kickin diggin a ditch for different spitters
weak lyricists get disfigured sip liquor
spit like a sick mixture of notorious pun and l; get the big picture
the poster i'll roast ya
my mind's so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
it's over control my whole coastal region 
like i'm supposed ta flow is goin postal even
open season heart close to freezin
ruthless as eazy nigga approach i'm squeezin
believe me dopest west coaster breathin
so most ya hope i'm vegan nope i'm beefin
rappers need to keep it trill gimme a beat to kill
too many people still eatin sleepin pills people sleepin on my ether skills
and y'all ain't even real   you 'bout to die in the cypher
before you die you should do the jada and leave a will
for real


 i ain't a rap dude i'm a dude who rap
before this i was movin crack
them killers y'all become when y'all rhyme i salute and dap
and if i blink then remove your snaps
you ain't cool you wack with y'all foolish act
skinny jeans don't mean yo' ass shoot it means your booty claps
haha don't play like tyler perry
this the slaughter house of pain flow brown tight and heavy
when it come to sixteens i'm a fiend
seen in a studio near a needle with a mean lean
probably writin bars to nas' "thief's theme"
gettin my yaowa on they all these olajuwon's we the dream team
this is an all day slaughter
they fiendin for us to break like beyoncé's water
the four quarters doin all the eatin
and y'all gotta know why i made the cut i'm puerto rican
ortiz keep the fire ready
and tryin to put me out's like tryin to steal a transvestite from eddie
hahaha


yeah i'm do or die dope
and you can make the sticker sittin on the door of that phantom your suicide note
hi rihanna is nicki livin wit'chu
let me know so i can buy binoculars and telescopes
hi rihanna i don't need to know you better
you tell me you love my music again we go together
bye rihanna now back to y'all fools
we rock out like the outside of a guitar school
thousand dollar frames i prefer to see the world through
don't ask me nothin 'bout budden i  my girl too
you ask me why do i keep her i say it's cheaper to
that's why i ride around in the rolls like wiz khalifa do
rappers i'm your daddy i'll tell you straight as this
you don't kill but your father will like jayden smith
i'll tell you like i tell my spanish chick
you fly but i ain't goin down on no landing strip
so get your wax on like daniel san
now i'ma have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
point out the greatest rapper alive i'll head shot him
smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
while i'm cyber sexin with jessica alba via skype
i'm on my d boy deebo thing
spiritual steelo swing like cee lo green
get out the camera with your b roll bling you know your flow is wack
we cornered market like a walmart in a cul de sac
yeah this what two millions singles sold
and the album that's gold look like without havin to sell your soul
nickel

 wait can i rap
 you the boss you better get 'em
 me rap
 represent


aiyyo lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal
subliminal in your swimmin pool 


you 'bout to see peace destroyed it'll never be restored
when i unleashed these beastly hordes on your cd stores
wanna stop it you gon' need a priest at least three swords
a license to ill from the beastie boys three ouija boards
and a squeegee and please be warned don't ask what the squeegee's for
or the holy water acid rap that'll eat these floors
eat a hole in the rhyme book you see these horns
and as for me you ask when i'm gone "will he be mourned"
 is puke lukewarm
should casey anthony do porn 
can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a frickin shoebox with a shoe horn
smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on
can she duct tape and velcro a fetus
joell yo tell joe i need his
empty box from his old shelltoe adidas
so i can put these babies in the fetal position
they gettin elbows to the penis yeah big deal
i took some little kid's big wheel and spit in his frickin big kid's meal
quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still
did you just put your 6 inch heel through my benz windshield
 is it dust we 'bout to kick up
can yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
between the stick shift in his frickin pick up
and drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will 'til he gets hiccups
flippin the script up
like mike vick gettin bit in his junk by a pit yup i'm a sick pup
i'd be a horrible magician cause i'll  a trick up
fix your lips up to say somethin fly or zip up
a b let's c/see
you said you're gonna do x y z
'til you  around and get dropped like an e when you add an i n g
don't put a k in front of that though when i emcee/m c
cause i'm not the king of this microphone booth it's more like a phone booth
superman in this bitch kryptonite won't do
that gives me more power
i bump the fat boys and eat rat poison take meteor showers
fresh out of the mental hospital
and me not flossin a middle finger while i hop in a moshpit'll
be like nas doin gospel or 
r&b you crazy me pushin up daisies that thought is impossible
as if flashin across the news posdnous was caught with a prostitute
with a huge johnson boobs and monstrous tube 
of lube and a bra some boots and panties and an aqua blue mazda
swallowin a popsicle playin tonsil pool
so kill the rumors it ain't happenin
i'ma rap 'til i'm fossil fuel
psst hey listen
i love my job makes me feel like superman 
can you fly i can   wanna see


i am only entertainin' you my
goal is to stimulate makin' you high
and take you and i to a place you can't see
but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you




my lyrical content is constantly under fire no wonder why
constantly bombed back to combat attacks to constant concepts
when lyrics are constantly took out of context
failure to communicate with congress has
been a problem for the longest i guess but
maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought see how long it takes to digest
feelin' good when i should be ashamed
shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came
like a flame in the night like a ghost in the dark
there's a ray there's a light there's a hope there's a spark
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide to set their differences aside
and this is why only one of us will survive
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because


i am only entertainin' you
my goal is to stimulate makin' you high
and take you and i to a place you can't see
but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you




my music can be slightly amusin'
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'
tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid ain't it i get sick just tryin' to explain it
see i could sit and argue wit' you but it goes beyond
just bein' a snot pointy nosed bleach blonde
'cuz i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
constantly movin' constantly usin'
the constitution as a form of restitution
bless the children nothin' less than brilliant
"let me entertain you" like robbie williams
i'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
world revolvin' still evolvin' still slim
how many kids'll copy probably millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then 'cuz


i am only entertainin' you
my goal is to stimulate makin' you high
and take you and i to a place you can't see
but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you




my lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fucked up
young kids at an alarmin' rate common denominate
add it up and you see just why i dominate
i try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make slim you great
but wait can't you see i'm only hear to entertain
i gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cuz now i see it feel it live it but it's inhumane
for me to see you be influenced then pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i been through pain
if you get to know me i can be a friend you gain
but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy prolly tears you up inside as much
and as such i pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but


i am only entertainin' you
my goal is to stimulate makin' you high
and take you and i to a place you can't see
but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad not your mom not your guardian
just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you





artist: eminem
album:  shade 45 promo
song:   step right up
typed by: basicreasoning@yahoocom

step right up
i'm about to light up the skyline so bright i'ma fuck your whole night up
fuck ya glow sticks and go stick a stick in ya ass
this is the ghost of christmas past
this is ya ho she's supposed to kiss his ass
this is gross but listen close
if you don't you can go stick ya whole frickin' nose against his crack
'till he lets one go and blows ya whiskers back
and get a great big 'ol whiff cuz if you last
without passing out you'll be on the next episode of fear factor
ya i'm back to back to what i dont know smack a little child actor's butt
mike jackson what what the fuck you want i got a blunt 
and some jesus juice who needs an excuse these days
the way they rally around pedophiles your lucky i don't pee in your face
i can do anything and apologize for it later 
as long as it aint a racist tape from '88 than i'm straight a
that cannot be forgave 
if i drank pee for eighteen years straight
and ate shit every day on a porcelain plate
that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak
knife for the rest of my life
and had to watch my ex wife get fucked by vanilla ice
twice a day cuz i said n i g g a when i was a teenager
blaow blaow shade a
forty five shorty let me get your number baby 
maybe i can hump your leg or
something but its time for me to go
so i stopped jumped in the vehicle
its like this because of that boob right
it is not about lyrics anymore
it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook


if we gotta dumb down our style and a b c it
then so be it cause nowadays these kids
jeez don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playin them hits
"oh this my jam this my shit
we don't know a word to a verse all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us"
and the song's ginormous the whole formula's switched
cause we don't know anymore what are hits
is it the beat is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 8 0 8 clap
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when 13 year olds control the remotes
and ashlee's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new em phas is on our syl la lables


if the emphasis on a compact disc
isn't a beat then i'm gon' feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range rove'
cause e'rywhere i go they love the bling bling flow
the bang bang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing' cost jermaine a lot of dough 
the fuck am i bustin my brain fo'
it's just the way the game go and oh it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too i just found the angle
hehe no more reality flows
i'm tryin to time my album droppin with a reality show
cock the mac 11 front of hot 97
and call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
hehe no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chat room or the house in malibu
em your emphasis is on the wrong syl la lable


jay said 30's the new 20 funny
must mean 40's the new 30 interestin
cause ever since then it's been in essence an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit comin out right now it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said it's his last then 50 and em
then what "detox" drops what do we got then
so now our whole camps is runnin around scramblin
over what to do gamblin
every time we put a record out just lookin for that hook

 wait dre look~


shorty i love youuuuuuu
and you loooove me tooooooo
we were meant to be
cause shorty you love meeeeeee
and i loooove you tooooooo
and i promise i'll be true to you


go shorty it's your birthday
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
it's the kid that flip flows who used to flip o's
i run g for days you should see how i get hoes
i'm international i get my dick licked 'round the globe
i'm sick right into shows when ridin on lo lo's
puffin on cocoa my bitch in manolo's
don't fuck with the dodos that's slang for dumb hoes
think i'm playin i ain't got time to joke joke
you fuck around you could get yo' ass smoked loc
it's not a game me b i ain't playin
be behind me playa so you here anyway
you don't hear what i'm sayin me finini nay
fee fideedee day just give me my check then i'll be on my way
sonny bunny money you're funny
you ain't even listenin and i just took your money


there once was a time everywhere he turned
shady/aftermath was all you heard
but they said 50 sang too much and em got soft
and they said dre just fell the fuck off
well fuck the fuck offs all y'all eat salt
be mad we back fresh up out of the vault oh
new syl la lables eat balls you fuck offs
yo' house yo' bitch i'm gettin sucked off
east south midwest even up north
fallin victim to wax spittin bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
catch me if you can i'm runnin past while y'all walk


shady made me for bringin it back
for the history of rap it's gone with a snap
a snare and a clap
what happened to just spittin 'bout livin in the muh'fuckin city you at
in the grimiest condition i breathe in drama
king mathers and ca$h meet that's freak karma
i'm everything anything you could never be
it's a hittin rhymin a month deep in the beat
i speak with a piece no peace on my mind
i repeat every evil deed done to mine
no rest contest contract is signed
by blood i'm in this squad for life
air out my windpipes and i just chime
i'm the reason you guys won't say that line
i'm crazy "renagade" like em and jay z
i'm rosemary's baby i want you to hate me




it is not about lyrics anymore 
it's about a hot beat a hot beat 
a hot hot hot beat and a catchy hook 
nobody gives a damn about them syllables syl la lables
whatever they are
i don't care if they gotta rhyme schmoe moe joe toe and flow
now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
that's why my brain is out of order
that's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
but as the world turns and i keep growing older
i be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
bitch till hell freezes over
i be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
and as the world turns and i keep growing older
i be living this hip hop till hell freezesover

yo i use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
i think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
i go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
and smoke pot till i get high and i stare at shit for too long
like this weed is laced aint it taste tainted
your whole place fainted i woke up with my face painted
spaced out like sci fi tv
fuck icp buy my cd
cause while i'm screaming while i'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while i shave you
aint no shame in my game i turn the party out
making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth


that's why my brain is out of order
that's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
but as the world turns and i keep growing older
i be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
bitch till hell freezes over
i be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
and as the world turns and i keep growing older
i be living this hip hop till hell freezesover

yo speed racer 97' burgundy blazer
wanted for burglary had to ditch the mercury tracer
i'm on some low ish 
i'm fed up wit the being broke ish
i'm not to joke wit
bitch i don't sell crack i smoke it
my brains dusted; i'm disgusted at all my habits
too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause i'm always too blunted
walkin' up in the cypher smokin' talkin' like "who want it"
thug and crook; every drug in the book i've done it
my 9's at your frameis that your chain run it
who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor
aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your progressive pager
spectacular battle rap manufacturer
stole your mom's acura wrecked it then sold it back to her
  )
the doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
i'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you 
and i'ma make sure you come back for it
so barricade your infants put up some extra fences
a woman beater wanted for repeated sex offenses 
take em' on long vacation trips
kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
mess up your face and lips
slit your stomach and watch your gut split
gut you wit that razor that i use to shave my nuts wit  )
mama don't you cry your son's too far gone
i'm so high i don't even know what label i'm on
i'm messed up feelin' like an over worked plumber
i'm sick of the crap what's dr kevorkian's phone number  
yo blast me off tim
blast me off son
blastin' off right now son

i wasn't born mean i was pushed to treachery
i walk the streets lookin' for some puss to fetch me
i'm like a veggie brain is turned to mush i'm edgy
edgy enough to give reggie bush a wedgie
if he don't gimme kin things could get messy
so pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
and press against the right one till its smushed against me
and leave a dead body in the woods to mc with the christopher reeves beef
we started out on the wrong foot or should i say fake leg made out of wood
i shouldn't yes i should
riding through the hood i'm chillin' with westwood
i'm quite mellow a white fellow
my pee is bright yellow i like jello i'm like hello
to a cute little dyke on the mic i'm kinda like


me and westwood blastin' off jackin' off
in a pair of acid washed bumpin' asher roth
cruisin' grassy 'till i damn near crash the car
tryna smash 'em off in the dash hit the overpass went off
over the bridge into oncoming traffic
cause a massive forty two car pile up not a scratch at all
hopped up holdin' a axe and saw
jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tobasco sauce
spittin' flames kickin' fire out ur ass you little  
you can pass it on i'm battery acid dog
you don't wanna get my ass ticked off
i'm harder than playing basketball when i'm going through crack withdrawal
dick so big it's like elastic i tie it in a knot and it looks like mr fantastic
crossed the path of plastic man with a drastic forceput my penis on classic sports


once again it's the sinister cynical minister shady
kryptonite the superman he's a dennis to amy
administer of the pain just finish cover the paint
and muffle the fumes like it was nothin' because it ain't
anything in his way his enemies he just slays
his venom he spray reaches like beads of energy rays
menacing stares he glares making the hairs all on the back of yah neck stand
like dracula yep spectacular rep he's a tarantula gargantuan
yah angela so i command yah to start dancin'
part manson part hannibal part mechanical
sharpthrowing animal parts at scarlett johansen
enter my gas chamber yah gangsta my ass
he's got his fangs to your neck he's set to strangle ya ass hater
you're facin' a task greater he's chasin' your ass
he's got his face in a mask your blood stains on his glass table
i'm checking the exposure a full dose of me
exposing myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
with or without clothing next to the decomposing
bodies eroding while i'm dozing off overdosing
windows opening shutting doors opening closing i think there's a ghost
too much hydrocordone on coating
i was only 'sposed to swallow a half i took the whole thing
i'm not joking i think i just snorted my nose ring
i need a drink i'm standing over the sink posing
myself self loathing cause i'm on a brink postally
i don't wanna think this will make everything rosy
beverly sings scream while i'm severing three toesies
totally frozen while i close in i'm yodelling "rosey won't you come out to play"
a nuisance wasting time cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
making shrines of my crimes and capers
my words are whirlwinds i murder my girlfriends
go to europe and put nervines in my syrop and stirred 'em
you never heard 'em like this so don't encourage him
the neurosurgeon coke mirrors i'm lyrics worse than
the kinda person to get katie couric to cursin'
eighty spirits of ladies cause shady murdered the virgins
crazy turn him convinced that he emerged took over the world
and reeled in all the children lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels 
and still can spit drawn to gold like rumplestilskin
cotton to silk motrin to tylenol 3 pills the real slim shady's entered the buildin'
there's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch mildrid
he's ill wit it he still shouldn't be heeled
there's no one as sick as he mc's will get freakasied on the grill then


you wanna start with the hook first
you wanna start with the oh
i have no idea what i'm doing i have no idea what i'm doing but
everybody get up sit up christopher
they're miserable without you superman is a 
live and he's flowin like the mystic river

how did anybody ever find me i disa 
peared i was hiding in freeway's beard just a
hop skip and a jump from  my skin gushin'

sucka like a vicegrip my pin put ya

intro: frogg

and check out the man he goes by the name of er

verse one: eminem

slim shady brain dead like jim brady

i'm buzzin dirty dozen naughty rotten rhymer
cursin at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
you ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
admit it fuck it while we comin out in the open
i'm doin acid crack smack coke and smokin dope then
my name is marshall mathers i'm an alcoholic 
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it
better hide your wallet cause i'm comin up quick to strip your cash
bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
bitch i'm comin out swingin so fast it'll make your eyes spin
you gettin knocked the fuck out like mike tyson 
the proof is in the puddin just ask the deshaun holton
i'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than ron goldman

chorus:

so when you see me on your block with two glocks 
screamin _fuck the world_ like tupac
i just don't give a fuuuuuck
talkin that shit behind my back dirty mackin
tellin your boys that i'm on crack

so put my tape back on the rack

but see me on the street and duck
cause you gon' get stuck stoned and snuffed
cause i just don't give a fuuuuuck

verse two: eminem

i'm nicer than pete but i'm on a serch to crush a miilkbone
i'm everlast ing i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
flavor with no seasonin this is the sneak preview
i'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make your freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady eminem was the old initials 
extortion snortin supportin abortion
pathological liar blowin shit out of proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
with more holes than an afghan

chorus

verse three: eminem

somebody let me out this limousine 
i'm a caged demon on stage screamin like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend shootin up while this record is spinnin
clinically brain dead i don't need a second opinion
fuck droppin the jewel i'm flippin the sacred treasure
i'll bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin bosses bitchin while i'm washin dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin a headrush
doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade raped the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
i'm goin up over the curb drivin on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in

chorus

outro: eminem

hey fuck that
outsidaz
pace one
young zee
i hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack o lanterns
outsiders baby and we suing the courts
cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
they never should've booted me out of reform school
deformed fooltakin a shit in a warm pool
they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasn't me i got a twin 
it all started when my mother took my bike away
cuz i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that it was straight to the 40 ouncers
slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors
class clown freshman dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson i'll past the test guessin
and all the other kids said eminem's a dishead
he'll never last the only class he'll pass is phys ed
may be true till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast 
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transformin 
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
grabbed that bitch by her hair
drug her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach its too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

chorus

as the world turns
these are the days of our lives
these are the things that we must go through
day by day


we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders and we suing the courts
cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
hypercondriac hanging out at the laundromat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standin by a pale of garbage
its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
i met a slut and said "what up its nice to meet ya"
i'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but i'm broke as fuck and i don't get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me i was bout to roll this next blunt
but i aint got no weed no phillies or no papers
plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money
and don't try nothin funny
cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me
i went to grab my gun
thats when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors
started causin a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smokin crack all day
and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her
but so i gotta catch her first
ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in
and shot her fuckin porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room
thats when i seen the bedroom door shut
i know you're in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said "come in its unlocked"
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
she said "come her big boy lets get acquainted"
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothin could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
i started to beg "no please let go"
but she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left now i'm hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den go go gadget dick
whipped that shit out and aint no doubt about it
it hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
i shouted "now bitch lets see who gets the best"
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death 
come here bitch
come here
take this motherfuckin dick
bitch come here

chorus to fade

and as we go along
throughout the days of our lives
we all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
that we must go through
these are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
every day
every single day the world keeps turning


i reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
you know there's a story behind that there saloon
twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
sheriffs couldn't stop em
quickest damn gun slingers i've ever seen
got murdered in cold blood
that ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
and on a quiet night
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da five nine


i don't speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
and a noise is bred picked up and transmitted through royce's head 
trapped him in his room possessed him and hoist his bed
till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side he made a choice and said


who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hell ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal i'm not a fair man disgraced the race of a atheist
intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over worked its like the nazis in the nations
collaborating attemptin to take over the earth


cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve segal
above the law cuz i don't agree wit police either 
we ain't eager to be legal
so please leave me wit the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three amounts
when i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
 no i'm not i just want to shoot up and i'm pissed off
cuz i can't find a decent vain


the disaster wit dreds
i'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cuz i serve any stranger wit money
i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
serve this lobbyist strangle your body then confirm you
whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws 
wit my fists wrapped in gause dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazin mc's at the same time amazin mc's
somehow mc's ain't that eye brow raisin to me
>from all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
and bust till volcanoes errupt


*phone rings*
hello  aiyyo what's up 
stop they know it's us


i used to be a loudmouth remember me 
i'm the one who burned your house down 
well i'm out now  and this time i'm comin back to blow your house up
and i ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
and you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
and when i go to hell and i'm gettin ready to leave
i'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

 
cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve segal
against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel
 see you in hell
wall street royce da five nine slim shady
see you in hell for the sequel 
bad meets evil what 


and so that's the story when bad meets evil
two of the most wanted individuals in the county
made jesse james and billy the kid look like law abiding citizens
it's too bad they had to go out the way they did
got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
but their spirits still live on till this day
shhh wait did y'all hear that
 scalpel
  here
 sponge
  here
 wait he's convulsing he's convulsing
  ah
 we're gonna have to shock him
  oh my  oh my god
 we're gonna have to shock him
  oh my god


these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a neck with bolts "nurse we're losin him check the pulse"
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny lookin white boy scrawny and always ornery
cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
and i might snap one day just like that
i decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
  my first day in junior high this kid said
"it's you and i three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
i looked at my watch it was one twenty
"i already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me"
he said "don't try to run from me you'll just make it worse"
my palms were sweaty and i started to shake at first
something told me "try to fake a stomach ache it works"
i screamed "owww  my appendix feels like they could burst
teacher teacher quick i need a naked nurse"
 "what's the matter"
 "i don't know my leg it hurts"
 "leg  i thought you said it was your tummy"
 "oh i mean it is but i also got a bum knee"
 "mr mathers the fun and games are over
     and just for that stunt you're gonna get some extra homework"
 "but don't you wanna give me after school detention"
 "nah that bully wants to beat your ass and i'ma let him"

chorus: repeat 2x

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song


brain damage
way before my baby daughter hailey
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named d'angelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him "we shouldn't beef"
but he just wouldn't leave he kept chokin me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said "you gonna die honkey"
the principal walked in  
and started helpin him stomp me
i made them think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
"this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin you back bully  now once and for good"
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
 made it home later that same day
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin "what are you on drugs
look at you you're gettin blood all over my rug"  
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed "look bitch what have you done"
 "oh my god i'm sorry son"
 "shut up you cunt"  i said "fuck it"
took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

chorus


brain damage
it's brain damage
i got brain damage
it's brain damage
it's probably brain damage
it's brain damage
brain damage
i got brain damage
justin 
it's zoe um 
kelly did not have me call however i just listened to eminem in her car and 
it is the most disgusting thing i have ever heard in my entire life 
and i seriously wanna call his fucking agent 
and tell him how fucking disgusting he is 
it like makes me upset
i'm now nauseous and i can't eat lunch
goodbye
i feel like i'm walkin a tight rope without a circus net
poppin percocet i'm a nervous wreck
i deserve respect; but i work and sweat for this worthless check
i'm bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt
minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage 'specially when i'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper it's got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers maybe i'll ask nicer
watchin ballers while they flossin in they pathfinders
these overnight stars becomin autograph signers
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small fry's and average half pinters
but playa haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas
cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
when snakes slither in the grass spineless


that's rock bottom   when this life makes you mad enough to kill
that's rock bottom   when you want somethin bad enough to steal
that's rock bottom   when you feel like you've had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear


my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
i'm hopin things look up; but there ain't no job openings
i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
living in this house with no furnace unfurnished
and i'm sick of workin dead end jobs with lame pay
and i'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
cause when we die we know we all going the same way
cause it's cool to be player but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan
i'm comfortable and roomy in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of sess a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but i'm too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away




there's people that love me and people that hate me
but it's the evil that made me this backstabbin deceitful and shady
i want the money the women the fortune and fame
if it means i end up burnin in hell scorchin in flames
if it means i'm stealin your checkbook and forgin your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
cause right now i feel like just hit the rock bottom
i got problems   now everybody on my blocks got 'em
i'm screamin like them two cops when tupac shot 'em
holdin two glocks hope your doors got new locks on 'em
my daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
and them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on 'em
and while you flauntin 'em i could be takin 'em to shops to pawn 'em
i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em
cause i ain't never went gold off one song
i'm runnin up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

	hmm hmm hmhmhmmhm ahhh whooooo  shit
	yo mic check
	testing one two um twelve

	this is my dance song 
	can you hear me

	aight ay turn my headphones up



my favoite color is red like the blood shed
from kurt cobain's head when he shot himself dead
women all grabbin at my shishkabob
bought lauryn hill's tape so her kids could starve

you thought i was ill and now i'm even more so
shit i got full blown aids and a sore throat
i got a wardrobe with an orange robe 
i'm in the fourth row signin autographs at your show

i just remembered that i'm absent minded
wait i mean i've lost my mind i can't find it
i'm freestylin every verse that i spit
cause i don't even remember the words to my shit 
i told the doc i need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
put my lp on your christmas gift list
you wanna get high here bitch just sniff this

  
cum on everybody 


yo yo yo yo yo
i tried suicide once and i'll try it again
that's why i write songs where i die at the end
cause i don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
and i was wavin it at everybody screamin "i suck"  
i go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud "all y'all get the hell out now"
fuck rap i'm givin it up y'all i'm sorry

i'm bored out of my gourd    so i took a hammer 
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my ford
guess i'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket 
one excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
i feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
  and if you ever see a video for this shit
i'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

  
cum on everybody 


got bitches on my jock out in east detroit
cause they think that i'm a motherfuckin beastie boy 
so i told em i was mike d
they was like "gee i don't know he might be"
i told em "meet me at kid rock's next concert
i'll be standin by the loch ness monster  peace out "
then i jetted to the weed house
smoked out til i started bustin freestyles
broke out then i dipped quick back to the crib put on lipstick
crushed up the tylenol and ate it with a dipstick 
cum on everybody

life by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
and everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret indentities
and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
what is life
i'm tired of life
i'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
i'm tired of committing so many sins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never having any ends
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
i'm tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins
tired of not having a deal
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
tired of drowning in my sorrow
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
i'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
i'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why i'm smartin off
i'm tired of being fired everytime i fart and cough
tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
i'm tired of using plastic silverware
tired of working in building square
tired of not being a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

i'm tired of being white trash broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
i'm tired of not having a phone
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on
tired of not driving a bm
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of not sleeping without a tylenol pm
tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
tired of not being on tour
tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a contour
i'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
tired of being stared at
i'm tired of wearing the same damn nike air hat
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on "nobody's as ill as me"
i'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
tired of j l b saying "where hip hop lives"

but if i had a million dollars
i'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand i'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on while i'm on the john
if i had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough because i'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
if i had one wish
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

you know what i'm saying
i'm tired of all of this bullshit
telling me to be positive
how'm i 'sposed to be positive when i don't see shit positive
know what i'm sayin
i rap about shit around me shit i see
know what i'm sayin  right now i'm tired of everything
tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
can't get no airplay you know what i'm sayin
but ey it's cool though you know what i'm sayin
just fed up
that's my word
who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough 
told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl 
gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
sold a billion tapes and still screamed "fuck the world"
 so come and kill me while my name's hot
and shoot me twenty five times in the same spot 
i think i got a generation brainwashed
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot 
stop they blood flow until they veins clot
i need a pain shot and a shot of plain scotch
purple haze and acid raindrops
spike the punch at the party and drink pop 
shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
bad boy i told you that i can't stop
you gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
so everybody buy my shit or i'ma come and kill you

i got mushrooms i got acid i got tabs and aspirin tablets
i'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
you know me i'm your friend when you need a minithin
 i'm shady


i like happy things i'm really calm and peaceful 
i like birds bees i like people
i like funny things that make me happy and gleeful 
like when my teacher sucked my wee wee in preschool 
the ill type i stab myself with a steel spike
while i blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
cause this is how i am in real life 
i don't want to just die a normal death i wanna be killed twice 
how you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet 
so bring the money by tonight   cause your wife 
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life 
i try to keep it positive and play it cool
shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school 
cause i'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
tonight i think i'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

i got mushrooms i got acid i got tabs and aspirin tablets
i'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
you know me i'm your friend when you need a minithin
 i'm shady


yo i listen to your demo tape and act like i don't like it 

six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 

people don't buy shit no more they just dub it

but they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it i've got herpes while we on the subject 
and if i told you i had aids y'all would play it
cause you stupid motherfuckers think i'm playin when i say it

i just wanna make a few things clear
my baby mama's not dead  she's still alive and bitchin 
and i don't have herpes my dick's just itchin

ok i'm going to attempt to drown myself 
you can try this at home 
you can be just like me

mic check one two we recordin 
i'm cancerous so when i diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for canibus
i strangled you to death then i choked you again
then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
you beef wit me i'ma even the score equally
take you on jerry springer and beat yer ass legally
i get you blunted off of funny home grown
cause when i smoke out i hit the trees harder than sonny bono
  so if i said i never did drugs
that would mean i lie and get fucked more than the president does
hillary clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
i ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet 
my nerves hurt and lately i'm on edge
grabbed vanilla ice and ripped out his blonde dreads 
every girl i ever went out wit is goin lez
follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed take pills drop outta school kill people and drink
and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
i'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
so i'm dumb enough to ask for a date with lauryn hill
some people only see that i'm white ignorin skill
cause i stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
but i don't get pissed y'all don't even see through the mist
how the fuck can i be white i don't even exist
i get a clean shave bathe go to a rave
die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
my middle finger won't go down how do i wave
and this is how i'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

	now follow me and do exactly what you see
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
	i slap women and eat shrooms then od
now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

me and marcus allen went over to see nicole
when we heard a knock at the door must have been ron gold'
jumped behind the door put the orgy on hold
killed em both and smeared blood in a white bronco 
my mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
i slapped garth brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
i'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
that'll spray an aerosol can up at the ozone layer 
my rap style's warped i'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
jumped in a chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
and beat up foghorn leghorn with an acorn
i'm bout as normal as norman bates with deformative traits
a premature birth that was four minutes late
mother are you there  i love you
i never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
will someone explain to my brain that i just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and i'm in pain
i take a breather and sighed; either i'm high or i'm nuts
cause if you ain't tiltin this room neither am i
so when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
then it probably is obvious i got it on with her
cause when i drop this solo shit it's over with
i bought cage's tape opened it and dubbed over it

	i came to the club drunk with a fake id
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
	i've been with 10 women who got hiv
now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
	i got genital warts and it burns when i pee
don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
	i tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
you probably wanna grow up to be just like me eminem as susan 
 eminem as dave
 eminem as john
 eminem as ron

chorus: repeat 2x 

i never meant to give you mushrooms girl
i never meant to bring you to my world
now you sitting in the corner crying
and now it's my fault my fault


i went to john's rave with ron and dave
and met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
a nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
susan    an ex heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music 
told me she was goin back into usin again 
i said "wait first try this hallucinogen
it's better than heroin henn the booze or the gin
c'mere let's go in here"  *knocks on the door*
"who's in the den"
 "it's me and kelly"
"my bad  let's try another room"
 i don't trust you
"shut up slut  chew up this mushroom
this'll help you get in touch with your roots
we'll get barefoot buttnaked and run in the woods
 oh hell i might as well try em this party is so drab
"oh dag"

"i ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"

chorus: 1st repeat em says "i'm sorry" at the end

"yo sue"

i wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
i just wanted to make you appreciate nature
susan stop cryin i don't hate ya
the world's not against you i'm sorry your father raped you
so what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
that ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
she said

i said "i'm high too bitch quit grabbin my t shirt"  
"would you calm down you're startin to scare me"
she said
 i'm twenty six years old and i'm not married
    i don't even have any kids and i can't cook
 i'm over here sue  you're talkin to the plant look
we need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late 
cause i never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate

chorus: 1st repeat em says "whoops" after first line
        and "it was an accident" at the end
        2nd repeat same as original chorus

susan   where you goin  you better be careful
 leave me alone dad i'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
i'm not your dad quit tryin to swallow your tongue
want some gum  put down the scissors 'fore you do somethin dumb
i'll be right back just chill baby please
i gotta go find dave he's the one who gave me these
"john where's dave at before i bash you"
 he's in the bathroom; i think he's takin a crap dude
"dave  pull up your pants we need an ambulance
there's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off and there's only two days left 
of spring break how long do these things take to wear off"
 well it depends on how may you had
"i took three she ate the other twenty two caps
now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs drinkin lysol"
 she's gonna die dude
"i know and it's my fault"

hi kids  do you like violence  
wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids  
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did  
try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is  
my brain's dead weight i'm tryin to get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to impregnate  
and dr dre said "slim shady you a basehead"
uh uhhh  "so why's your face red  man you wasted"
well since age twelve i've felt like i'm someone else
cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
c'mere slut  
i don't give a fuck god sent me to piss the world off

chorus


my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
thanks a lot next semester i'll be thirty five
i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers  
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
extraterrestrial runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me: "let's just be friends"
ninety nine percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do  
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin usher fans  
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph

so i signed it: 'dear dave thanks for the support asshole'

chorus


stop the tape  this kid needs to be locked away  
dr dre don't just stand there operate
i'm not ready to leave it's too scary to die  
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
  am i comin or goin  i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka    dare me to drive  
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
  clothes ripped like the incredible hulk  
i spit when i talk i'll fuck anything that walks  
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom  
you ain't got no tits  
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  
i'm steamin mad   
and by the way when you see my dad  
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had

em what's goin' on
this is paul rosenberg here faithful attorney o' law
listen i er listened to the rough copy of your album and um 
you know i just gotta be honest with you
err could you turn it down a little bit
because there's only so much i can explain 
give you a call  skylar montgomery
 what do you want from me roger
  i know it was you all along messing around with my dear veronica
 wait a minute you hold it right there 
	 me and that woman love each other
  love 
	 what do you know of love
 we were destined to be together
	 i met her on the beach
  are you out to destroy me
 no roger that's not what i want to do
	 i love her and were going to be together
  never
a lot of people ask me am i afraid of death
hell yeah i'm afraid of death
i don't want to die yet
a lot of people think that i worship the devil
that i do all types of retarded shit
look i can't change the way i think
and i can't change the way i am
but if i offended you  good
cause i still don't give a fuck

i'm zonin off of one joint stoppin a limo
hopped in the window shoppin a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue what year is this
fuck a needle here's a sword bodypierce with this
livin amuk never givin a fuck
gimme the keys i'm drunk and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in a cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re open your scab 
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
i've calmed down now    i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin this rhyme
cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time

chorus: 

for all the weed that i've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
to all the people i've offended   yeah fuck you too
to all the friends i used to have   yo i miss my past
but the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
for all the drugs that i've done   yo i'm still gon' do
to all the people i've offended   yeah fuck you too
for everytime i reminisce   yo i miss my past
but i still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass


i walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
and cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
i'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
cause i'm crushin the whole world in my palm
got your girl on my arm and i'm armed with a firearm
so big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron on
and the pants to match 
i get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
a brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
  causin hospital accidents
god help me before i commit some irresponsible acts again 

chorus


i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spend a million a track and went over my budget 
now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt
i can't rap anymore   i just murdered the alphabet
drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
i'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
i don't rap to get the women   fuck bitches 
give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
never ran with a click   i'm a posse
kamikaze strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
from the second i was born my momma lost me 
i'm a cross between manson esham and ozzy
i don't know why the fuck i'm here in the first place 
my worst day on this earth was my first birthday
retarded  what did that nurse say  brain damage
fuck i was born during the earthquake

chorus
yeahha ha ha  yeah bizarre kid comin' at you
eminem and fuzz and mr swifty ha ha

makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself you might as well

should be takin' my medication it's 9 to 10 i'm facin'
last week this old man i had to blast
cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
ripped this old lady hung her neck by a hook
didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til i checked her pocketbook
fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
better explain where the hell your tvs and vcrs is at
i done lost 100 pounds i ain't been eatin' like i should
this wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "everybody get out"
my girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2 piece
cuz she found out i was havin' an affair with her 10 year old niece

no one no one's iller than me
it's bizarre kid straight from the 313
no one no one is iller than me
it's bizarre kid straight from the 313


nobody better test me cuz i don't wanna get messy
especially when i step inside this bitch dick freshly
new lugz give the crew hugs guzzle two mugs
before i do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
true thugs rugged unshaven messy scrubs
whippin' 40 bottles like the fuckin' pepsi clubs
down a fifth crack open a six
i'm on my seventh 8 ball now i gotta take a piss
i'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
who gives a fuck who they was
i'm always takin' someone else's girl like cool j does
they probably don't be packin' anyways do they fuzz
we walked up stomped they asses and blew they buzz
mics get sandblasted
stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when i ran past it
fuckin' felon headed to hell in a handbasket
talkin' shit will get you your girl and your man blasted
kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in saran plastic
get your damn ass kicked by these fantastic
furious four motherfuckers
flashin' in front of your face without the grand masters

slim shady ain't nobody iller than me


i run shit like an ass with legs
massive lead to leave your cabbage red
similar to your ass in a casket dead
drastic spread of acid heads
come to abort you like a bastard egg
that trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
ask the feds from past the edge
rockin' the most classic threads
flashin' bread roll down the window
bitch you got some fantastic legs you can get 'til that ass get red
you can get 'til that ass get red
bizarre you get him and him swift you get him and him
i'll get him and him leave the other two for my nigga eminem

got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
some bitch ran up screamin' get the cops quick
and got drop kicked now she screamin' "stop it"
got clips to stop shit rock shit and grab this hot shit

     nooo
  
	     wake the fuck up motherfuck
     what do you want from me"
  
	     remember me
     i killed you
 thought i was dead didn't you
     what do you want from me
 i'm alive
     oh god
 huh huh huh
	     get up
     no
 get up and look in the mirror
     i don't want to
 look in the mirror
     leave me alone
 to see your reflection 
             look in the mirror
     leave me alone
 you're nothing
	     you're nothing without me
     leave me alone
	     look in the motherfucking mirror
     leave me alone
 
     nooooo 

 i'm low down and i'm shiftee
"and if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
 and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from"

i lace tunes i'm out this world like space moons
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
nothing but idiots and misfits dipshits
doing whippits passed out like sanford snippits
where's the weed i wanna tamper with it
i'ma let your grandpa hit it
mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
fuck it maybe i'm a bum
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what i'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
losing all of my leverage
went up inside the first national bank broke and left rich
walking bio hazard causing wreckage
smoked out like eckridge
band just making my neck itch
what the fuck gimme the tech bitch
you just lost your tip there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
slap hips support domestic violence
beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
i'm just joking is dirty dozen's really dust smoking
if all your shit's missing than probably one of us broke in

chorus

my head's ringing like it was spider sense tingling
lit it like green bay did when they shitted on new england
i'm out the game put the second string in
this brandy got my swinging
bobbing back and forth like a penguin
delinquent toking microphones with broken english
make your mama be like "ohh this is good who sing this"
"slim shady his tape is dope i love it
it's rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
it was predicted by a medic
i'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
living off liquid triametic
pathetic but i don't think this headache's ever vanishing
panicing i think i might have just took too much anasin
frozen manaquin posted stiffer than a statue
i think i'm dying god is that you
somebody help me before i od on an lp
take me to er asap for and iv
motherfuck jlb they don't support no hip hop
they say that's where it ends the closest they gon come is tupac
it's politics it's all a fix
setup by these white blue collared hicks
just to make a dollar off of black music
with a subliminal ball of tricks
but those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

"all i see is murder murder my mind state"  > 2pac
murder murder murder and kill kill kill


left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
went up in eastland and shot a policeman
fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands here's yo' life span
and for what yo' life's worth; this money is twice than
you grab a couple grand and lay up in iceland
see i'm a nice man but money turned me to satan
i'm thirsty for this green so bad i'm dehydratin
hurry up with the cash bitch i got a ride waitin
shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin
i want the whole pie i won't be denied nathan
maybe i need my head inside straightened
brain contemplatin clean out the register
dip before somebody catches ya
or gets ya description and sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
but i ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
cause i got a daughter to feed
and $200 ain't enough to water the seed the best thing
would be for me to leave taco bell and hit up chess king
and have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin the mac
cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
this bitch tried escapin the jack
grabbed her by the throat it's murder she wrote
you barely heard a word as she choked
it wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
then i slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
just then the pigs bust in yellin "freeze"
but i'm already wanted for sellin ki's
and bunch of other felonies from a to z like spellin bees
so before i dropped to the ground and fell on knees
i bust shots they bust back
hit the square in the chest he wasn't wearin a vest




left the house pullin out the drive backin out
we were backin out this lady's jag started blackin out
pulled the mac 10 out stuck it in her face
shut ya yakkin mouth 'fore i blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
drug her by her hair smacked her up
thinkin fuck it mug her while you're there jacked her up
stole her car made a profit
grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on "set it off" did
jetted off kid stole the whip now i'm a criminal
drove it through somebody's yard dove into they swimmin pool
climbed out and collapsed on the patio
i made it out alive but i'm injured badly though
parents screamin: "son go in and call the police
tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"
tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
smashed the window grabbed the nintendo 64
when they sell out in stores the price triples
i ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80 year old lady with groceries
there goes the cheese eggs milk and post toasties
stood up and started to see stars
too many siren sounds it seemed like a thousand police cars
barely escaped musta been some dumb luck
jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
but i think somebody seen me maybe
plus i lost the damn nintendo and i must a dropped the beanie baby
fuck it i give up i'm surrounded in blue suits
came out with a white flag hollerin "truce truce"
 surrendered my weapon to cops
wasn't me  it was the gangsta rap and the peppermint schnapps

america hahaha we love you
how many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech
the united states government has sworn to uphold
  or so we're told


i never woulda dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
it's like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
so many lives i touched so much anger aimed
in no particular direction just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who woulda thought; standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide reachin for a t shirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this
i must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
cause congress keep tellin me i ain't causin nuthin but problems
and now they're sayin i'm in trouble with the government   i'm lovin it
i shoveled shit all my life and now i'm dumpin it on


white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl; look how many hugs i get


look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shady lose shady sits on the shelf
but shady's cute shady knew shady's dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby  look at my sales
let's do the math   if i was black i woulda sold half
i ain't have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i could rap so fuck school i'm too cool to go back
gimme the mic show me where the fuckin studio's at
when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it   until i met dre the only one to look past
gave me a chance aand i lit a fire up under his ass
helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
like damn; we just swapped   sittin back lookin at shit wow
i'm like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now it's




see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til i created so much motherfuckin turbulence
straight out the tube right into your living rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin with a fine tooth comb it's like this rope
waitin to choke; tightenin around my throat
watchin me while i write this like i don't like this 
all i hear is: lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors working
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
hip hop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom
so now i'm catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin
actin like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the posterchild the motherfuckin spokesman now for




so to the parents of america
i am the derringer aimed at little erica to attack her character
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the  and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the free est of speech
this divided states of embarassment will allow me to have
fuck you



i'm just playin america you know i love you marshall sounds like an sos

so without further adieux i bring to you
	


you bout to witness hip hop in its most purest
more rawest form flow almost flawless
most hardest most honest known artist
chip off the old block but oh doc is back
looks like batman brought his own robin
oh god saddam's got his own laden
with his own private plane his own pilot
set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
oranges peach pears plums syringes



quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles
gee wilikers dre "holy bat syllables"
look at all the bullshit that goes on in gotham
when i'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
so skip to your lou while i do what i do best
you ain't even impressed no more; you're used to it
flows too wet nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up there's no such thing
like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
it just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin and you know what for
the show must go on; so i'd like to welcome y'all
to marshall and andre's car ni val c'mon now




it's just like old times the dynamic duo
two old friends why panic you already know
who's fully capable the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center eight zero zero
you can even call collect the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin a sweat
people steppin over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus how can shit be so easy
how can one chandra be so levy
turn on these beats mc's don't see me
believe me; bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo' sheezy
can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'til we grow beards get weird and disappear
into the mountains   nothin but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin around round here
yo dre  can i get hell  now




so there you have it folks  has come to save the day
back with his friend andre here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
because  and andre are here to stay
and never go away until our dying day
until we're old and grey 
so until next time friends same blonde hair same rap channel
good night everyone thank you for coming
your host for the evening 
oh heh
where's my snare
i have no snare in my headphones   there you go
yeah yo yo


have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have; i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin
tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin
not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as i'm breathin
keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now; i bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now


i'm sorry momma
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleanin out my closet 
i said i'm sorry momma
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry; but tonight
i'm cleanin out my closet


ha i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it; i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multi platinum sellin cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin her side
even if i hated kim i grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face them today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun
cuz i'da killed him; shit i woulda shot kim and them both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to "the eminem show"




now i would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin
but put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin
goin through public housin systems victim of munchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
'til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesn't it wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely
and nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony
and hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her   she won't even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song   keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch; i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead   dead to you as can be


uhhh nmm



this thing on
where'd everybody go
uhh
guess who's back
back again
ken is back
tell some men
rub my back
rub my back
rub my back
rub my back
oooh
wait
hello



uhh
goodbye
sometimes you just feel tired feel weak
and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you try to find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you
and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter
no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse


till i collapse i'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em
till the day that i drop you'll never say that i'm not killin 'em
cause when i am not then i'ma stop pinnin 'em
and i am not hip hop and i'm just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when i'ma stop sendin 'em
women are caught in webs spin 'em and hoch venom
adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
amoxacillin's just not real enough
the criminal cop killin hip hop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of 'pac listeners
you're comin with me feel it or not you're gonna fear it
like i showed ya the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin up
fo' shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
you bizzles forgot slizzel does not give a fuck


till the roof comes off till the lights go out
till my legs give out can't shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out   am i high perhaps
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse


music is like magic there's a certain feelin you get
when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend
tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
i got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes reggie jay z tupac and biggie
andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me
even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me




soon as the verse starts i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinkin how not to go against me smart
and it's absurd how people hang on ev ery word
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together ev ery verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like i'm a addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack i'm launchin at 'em
the track is on some battlin raps who want some static
cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest so



 until the roof
 until the roof
 the roof comes off
 the roof comes off
 until my legs
 until my legs
 give out from under me

 i will not fall i will stand tall
 feels like no one can beat me

   i'm sick
 damn you straight dog


that's why i ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin sick
that's how dicks be gettin drips
fallin victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


yo; i woke up fucked up off the liquor i drunk
i had a bag of the skunk won in last nights tunk
pussy residue was on my penis denise from the cleaners
fucked me good you shoulda seen this
big booty bitch switch unbearable
french roll stylin body like a stallion
sizin up the figure while my shit gettin bigger
debatin on a fuck or do i want to be her nigga
caressin this bitch plus i'm checkin out them tits
sippin on that fine shit i ain't used to buyin
i gotta hit it from behind it's mandatory
like takin hoe's money but that's another story
for surely the pussy on toast
after we toast her clothes fell like bishop in juice
the womb beater clean pussy eater
insertin my jock in that spot hotter than the hottest block
"don't stop" response i got when i was knockin it
clock steady tickin kinky finger lickin
and can on semen's at my tip when she moans
i gotta slow down before i cum soon
and work that nigga like a slave owner
when i dropped off my outfit she knew i wanted to bone her
she foamin at the lips the one between the hips
pubic hairs lookin like some sour cream dip
without the nacho my dick hit the spot though
pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
we in the final stretch the last part of sex
i bust a fat ass nut then i woke up next
like what the fuck is goin on here this bitch evaporated
pussy and all just picked up and vacated
now i'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
and dr wesley tellin me i really got that shit




now i don't wanna hit no woman but this chick's got it comin
someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant but she's eggin me on
beggin me to throw her off the steps of this porch
my only weapon is force
and i don't wanna resort to any violence of any sort
but what's she shovin me for doesn't she love me no more
wasn't she huggin me four minutes ago at the door
man i'm this close to goin toe to toe with this whore
what would you do if she was tellin you she wants a divorce
she's havin another baby of the month and it's yours
and you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin someone else
and suckin his dick and kissin you on the lips when you get back
to michigan now the plot is thickenin worse
cause you feel like you've been stickin your fuckin dick in a hearse
so you paranoid at every little cold that you get
ever since they told you this shit you've been holdin your dick
so you go to the clinic sweatin every minute you in it
then the doctor comes out lookin like dennis the menace
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's aids
he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it
so you jet back home because you gon' get that hoe
when you see her you gon' bend her fuckin neck back yo
cause you love her you never would expect that blow
obie told you the scoop how could she stoop that low
jesus i don't believe this bitch works at the cleaners
bringin me home diseases swingin from obie's penis
she's so deceivin shit this hoe's a genius
she g'd us



 i'm busy
  yeah fuck these bitches
 fuck 'em all
  get money shady records obie trice
  eminem motherfucker
  new millenium shit
  yeah turn this shit off
  turn this shit the fuck
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood 
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood {why do i feel this way)
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood
sayin goodbye i'm sayin goodbye to hollywood


i thought i had it all figured out i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself layin on my knees in cuffs
which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
and just leave   how come i couldn't see this shit myself
it's just me nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowin damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell
to catch me the minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standin here swingin like thirty people by myself
i couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
turned around saw gary stashin the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i don't need to go to jail
i'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down try to get my feet on solid ground so for now i'm




i bury my face in comic books cause i don't want to look
at nothin this world's too much i've swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would
and end it for good just say goodbye to hollywood
i probably should these problems are pilin all at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
i think i'm bottomin out but i'm not about to give up
i gotta get up thank god i got a little girl
and i'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
i'd be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i don't know how i do it
all i know is i don't want to follow in the footsteps
of my dad cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had was growin up to be like his fuckin ass
man if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans when i tell 'em i'm




i don't wanna quit but shit i feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
publicity stunt my ass consume my fuckin dick
fuck the guns i'm done i'll never look at gats
if i scrap i'll scrap like i ain't never whupped some ass
i love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact i've sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at
this is wack this is more than i ever coulda asked
everywhere i go a hat a sweater hood or mask
what about math how come i wasn't ever good at that
it's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
i'm trapped if i could go back i never woulda rapped
i sold my soul to the devil i'll never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine goin from bein a no one to seein
everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceein
it's fuckin crazy cause all i wanted was to give hailie
the life i never had instead i forced us to live alienated
so i'm sayin




goodbye
goodbye hollywood 
please don't cry for me 
when i'm gone for good 
so goodbye
goodbye hollywood 
please don't cry for me 
when i'm gone for good 
somedays i sit starin out the window
watchin this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think i'm crazy; i'm crazy oh so crazy
why am i here am i just wastin my time
but then i see my baby suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes


cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me


my baby girl keeps gettin older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side
i act like shit don't phase me; inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes




man if i could sing i'd keep singin this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes i'd blow somethin as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god i'm a daddy i'm so glad that her mom didn't 
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that i'ma pistol packin drug addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breakin
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances man it's too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothin to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facin   three felonies six years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i should have seen it comin what'd i stick my penis up in
wouldn't have ripped the pre nup up if i'da seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it it's over there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore hailie
so sayonara try tommorrow nice to know ya
our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted


and now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin on me
cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
nothing can take her from me


wooo told you i can't sing
oh well i tried
hailie remember when i said if you ever need anything
daddy would be right there guess what
daddy's here and i ain't going nowhere baby
i love you  i'm gonna kill this bitch
	 i'm gonna kill her
	 i'm going to fuckin' jail

 c'mon motherfucker
   maarrsshh

 daddy what are you doing
 okay then everybody listen up
 i'm goin to hell who's comin with me
 somebody please help him i think my dad's gone cray zayy


there's no mountain i can't climb there's no tower too high
no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you
to show you there ain't nothin i can't take this chainsaw to
 fuckin brains brawn and brass balls
i cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton john's name on my drag wall
i'm out the closet i've been lyin my ass off
all this time me and dre been fuckin with hats off
 so tell laura and her husband to back off
'fore i push this motherfuckin button and blast off
and launch one at these russians and that's all 
blow every fuckin thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop when will i knock the crap off
 hailie tell 'em baby   

  
there's really nothin else to say i i can't explain it

a little help from hailie jade won't you tell 'em baby

there's nothin you could do or say that could ever change me

there's no one on earth that can save me not even hailie



it's like my mother always told me
rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine
and god dammit you little motherfucker
if you ain't got nuthin nice to say then don't say nuthin
 uh fuck that shit bitch
eat a motherfuckin dick chew on a prick
and lick a million motherfuckin cocks per second
i'd rather put out a motherfuckin gospel record
i'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch eat pussy
and have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring
in my nose than quit bringin my flows
quit givin me my ammo; can't you see why i'm so mean
if y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my mo
i wouldn't have to go eenee meene mini moe
catch a homo by his toe man i don't know no more
am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more 




my songs can make you cry take you by surprise
at the same time can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme; see what you're seein is a genius at work
which to me isn't work
so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
cause when i speak it's tongue in cheek
i'd yank my fuckin teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue i'd slice my gums
get struck by fuckin lightnin twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ice's son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit everytime i sung
like r kelly as soon as "bump and grind" comes on
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade
standin on ronnie's grave screamin at the sky
'til clouds gather it's clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and that's pretty much the gist of it
the parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heater stashed in 2 seaters with meat cleavers
i don't blame you i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither




ha ha ha ha
you're funny daddy

typed by: ÇexyÇy


em it's paul
listen 
joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind the studio
shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
i told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot outside of your home
you're gonna get yourself in trouble
don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
leave your fuckin' gun at home
 so i'm out the game huh
  huh  yo dre we ridin
 whatever
  haha well i'm witcha homies
 okay; let's handle the small shit


i was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
kick up dust cuss 'til i slur up spit
grew up   too quick went through too much do too much shit
corrupt and i'm a pour it on like syrup bitch
thick and rich sick and twisted mr buttersworth
dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
 and if i fumble the verse keep goin
first take i make mistakes just keep it
no punches pulled no punches that's weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit i'll eat shit
wasn't for him wouldn't be shit


creep wit me as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i ain't got to lie about my age
 fuck jermaine
he don't belong speakin mine or timbaland's name
and don't think i don't read
your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin
i'm a giant and i ain't gotta move 'til i'm provoked
when i see you i'ma step on you and not even know it
you midget mini me with a bunch of little mini yous
runnin around your backyard swimmin pools
over 80 million records sold
and i ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds


cause what you say is what you say say what you say
how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember
how you said it when you were sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh


second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri
we'll rub it in every club you're in will have you
blackballed and make sure you never rap a fuckin gain
dre ain't havin it; long as i'm here to play devil's advocate


if there was some magic shit
i could wave over the industry that could save it when i'm gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on i would


if i could only use this power for good
i wouldn't; not even if i could


from the hood and i'm a hornet
and i'ma only sting when i'm cornered


and i'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
cause i know if they get up i won't get a chance to let off
another punch i'm punk rock no one's punk
don't give a fuck  white 'pac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mill'
and grow up to be atilla go nuts and be a pillar


and i'm somethin of a phenom'
one puff of the chron' i'm unstoppable
i'm alive and on top again
there's no obstacle that i can't conquer
so come along with us 




now anybody who knows dre
knows i'm about fast cars and alize partyin all day
but i handle my business cause it's work before play
don't look for trouble but i'll serve you gourmet
however you want it you can have it your way
you fuck my night up i'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name sendin it your way 
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
cause this is my space you invade it live to regret it
and you die tryin to violate it
fuck around get annihilated; eyes dilated


heh like my old lady
cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean
is two different things dependin on your mood if it swings
think too many things
little hit of dre's weed i can do anything
catch a contact then i'm gone and i'm back
i speed right; and my looseleaf's my launchpad


and i can pull any string
don't have to prove anything catch a contract on your head
you headed west talk shit about dre
you better get a vest and invest
in somethin to protect your head and neck


and it's back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say i'm best
in the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend
i'ma die a sudden death
five mics in the source  ain't holdin my fuckin breath
but i'll suffocate for the respect
'fore i'll breathe to collect a fuckin check



 watch your fuckin mouth

 yo this timbaland tell them i said suck *chka* my dick    
	    fuck


  
     
	    it's ridiculous i can't believe it what
	    hold on a minute
	    
	    em
    whuddup
     have a seat
	    
	    dre  i'll call you back
	    
    what now
     i don't even know where to start
    
	    okay
     i got the album from upstairs
    
	    and
     and this is by far the most



     
            incredible thing i've ever'eard
these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring
alone in his own zone cold and he don't care
he's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out
cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin back
talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap
his step father hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
there's no control he just let's his emotions go


c'mon sing with me 
sing for the year 
sing for the laughter sing for the tear 
sing it with me just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unnholy only have one homie
only this gun   lonely cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrate; or even worse they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune no more kissin ass
but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin to me religiously
so i'm signin cd's while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense b
it's all political if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldn't; i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too guerrera   that was a fist that hit you




they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can and the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
we entertainers of course the shit's affectin our sales
you ignoramus but music is reflection of self
we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
who post pin up pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin to you   but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

   repeat 2x
i'm a soldier 

yo never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta 'til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
took the image of a thug kept shit appealin
willin to stick out my neck for respect if it meant
life or death never live to regret what i said
when you're me people just want to see if it's true
if it's you what you say in your raps what you do
so they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
you're in violation any hesitation'll get you killed
if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
pull it squeeze it 'til it's empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze


i'm a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier even if my collar bones crush
or crumble i will never slip or stumble
i'm a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge i'll never fall or fold up
i'm a soldier even if my collar bones crush
or crumble i will never stumble


i love pissin you off it gets me off
like my lawyers when the fuckin judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
i'm a lit fuse anything i do bitch it's news
pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers six two
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
actually better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
it's like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin out their haltertops
runnin and duckin out the hot rocks parking lot
you'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not cause




i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin to 'em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
i'm like a thug with a little bit of 'pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rockin to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
don't even try it you'll look stupid do not pursue it
don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
so ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity




yo' left yo' left yo' left right left
people  it feels so good to be back 


ladies and gentlemen introducing the new
and improved you know who
chk who chka er chk er chk er chk


never been the type to bend or budge
the wrong button to push no friend of bush
i'm the center piece you're a maltese
i'm a pitbull off his leash all this peace talk can cease
all these people i had to leave in limbo
i'm back now i've come to release this info
i'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
cani bitch don't want no beef with slim
nooooooo not even on my radar

   repeat 2x
music reality
sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
but we as entertainers have a responsibility
to these kids psyche


if i were to die murdered in cold blood tommorrow
would you feel sorrow or show love or would it matter
could never be the lead off batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off i'm see saw battlin
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate i done came way
too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for a joke you smokin crack
'fore i do that i'd beg mariah to take me back
i'll get up 'fore i get down run myself in the ground
'fore i put some wack shit out
i'm tryin to smack this one out the park five thousand mark
y'all steady tryin to drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothin but piss me off lid to the can of whip ass
just twist me off see me leap out pull a piece out
fuck shootin i'm just tryin to knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitch let's see you freestyle
talk is cheap motherfucker if you really feelin froggish leap
yo slim you gon' let him get away with that
he tried to play you you can't let him skate with that
man i hate this crap
this ain't rap this is crazy the way we act
when we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops


ain't no gettin rid of mcvay if so you woulda tried
the only way i'm leavin this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically arrived back at my enemies' crib
with hennessey got drunk then i finished it 
i'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently
i'm not what you think
i appear to be fucked up mentally endangered
i can't stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
to awake neighbors for acres
i'll murder you i gauge and have me turn into a mad man
son of sam bitch i'm surgical
i'm allergic to dyin you think not
you got balls we can see how large when the music stops


i was happy havin a deal at first
thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dog
and you ain't got nuttin left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
beggin with their hands out checkin for your record when it's sellin
when it ain't that's the end no laughs no friends
no girls just the gin you drink till your car spin you think
damn when you slam into the wall
and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
i'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call
when the music stops


let's see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up lookin for you with a pistol sippin a can of penzoil
i'm revved up who said what when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff i'm handcuffed
tossed in the paddywagon; braggin about how you shouted
like a coward bullets devoured you showered you niggaz
if i was you niggaz i'd run while given a chance
understand i can enhance the spirit of man
death itself it can hurt me
just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop tryin to walk how g's walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playin tug of war with your life
fuck a tour and a mike i'd rather fuck a whore with a knife 
deliver that shit that coroner's like
you hype poppin shit in broad daylight
nigga you're a goner at night   when the music stops


instigators turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
y'all don't want war y'all want talk
in the dark my dogs all bark like woof
proof nigga i'ma wolf get your whole roof
caved in like reindeer hoofs
stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose
the more y'all breathe shit the more i moves
it's _hill street_ this is hardcore _blues_
put a gun to rap check in all our dues 
or make the news betcha all y'all move
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop


music has changed my life in so many ways
brain's confused been fucked since the 5th grade
ll told me to "rock the bells"
nwa said "fuck the police" now i'm in jail
ninety three was strictly r&b
fucked up haircut listened to jodeci
michael jackson   who gon' tell me i ain't mike
ass cheeks painted white fuckin priscilla tonight
flyin down sunset smokin crack
transvestite in the front eddie murphy in the back
mop had me grimey and gritty
marilyn manson i dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bows
now i'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
voices in my head i'm goin in shock
i'm reachin for the glock but the music stops 
two trailer park girls go round the outside;
round the outside round the outside

two trailer park girls go round the outside;
round the outside round the outside


guess who's back
back again
shady's back
tell a friend
guess who's back guess who's back guess who's back guess who's back
guess who's back guess who's back guess who's back 


i've created a monster cause nobody wants to see marshall no more
they want shady i'm chopped liver 
well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not co operating
when i'm rockin the table while he's operating 
you waited this long now stop debating
cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovu lating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits fuck you debbie


now this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody just follow me
cause we need a little controversy
cause it feels so empty without me


little hellions kids feelin rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feelin like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision of scary
could start a revolution pollutin the airwaves
a rebel so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin my ass 
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me
well i'm back na na na na na na na na na na
 fix your bent antenna tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in endin up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
 testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me




a tisket a tasket i go tit for tat with
anybody who's talkin this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby  you can get stomped by obie
you thirty six year old baldheaded fag blow me
you don't know me you're too old let go
it's over nobody listen to techno
now let's go just gimme the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol 
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm dis gus ting
but it's just me i'm just obscene
no i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and used it to get myself wealthy
 there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'll be so empty without me

hey
i thought it was evident that figg is in his element
whenever reality doesn't exsit my temperament
exposed by the evidence of festering excrement
hard to predict my shit even if you're a weatherman
forget it man my mind twisted like pretzels
so i'm glad to land a hand to ruin instrumentals
even though it's said my input is detrimental
to oz hip hop then switch off like you are meant to
i'm sent to fuck with your head bishop with dental
rearrange your face like mr squiggle's pencil
then escape like christopher skase without a trace
pockets are laced with cash laughin' all the way to the bank
so thank you for playin' the game but do not pass go
i'mma show these lame acts that the dice will roll
control yourself without losin' your bladder
i'm flattered that you care but like your opinion matters yeah


i rap i rap
they hate they hate
too late too late
coz nothing eva worries me
i just want you to know nothing eva worries me


if r kelly can take girls to never never land
and bush can blame osama and we never see the man
if pee wee can grab his dick and beat it with his hand
then why the fuck can'ti get high and meet with peter pan huh
i like nice asses and boobs
i like nitrous in plastic balloons and acid and shrooms
i need sluts i'm a pimp on a budget
always on the low with bitches that fuck fest
fuck yes success is when your teenage daughter sucks best
when high on substance
i left my visa at my rest ask lil' kim to borrow her plastic
she handed me her breast
nose and ass plus dildos
spent 20 thou on ebay for mj's real nose
i'm just kiddin' coz mike loves kiddin' around
then serving jesus juice to sit 'em all down


i rap i rap
they hate they hate
too late too late
coz nothing eva worries me
i just want you to know nothing eva worries me


so nothin' ever worries me scratchin' my balls in public
the paparazzi love it while figg is havin' his nuts licked
you need proof proof why people calling you fuckwit
coz my dick hangin' out when i normally tuck it
i'm stuck with wantin' women i have no luck with
i mean sex is excellent till they find i'm a nothin'
but like i'm denyin' the fact that i'm a nobody
when honestly it's a bother to stay with a woman properly
costin' me 4 dollars for her to spend the night with me
chastely rob her pockets even if she was nice to me
look for the hooker later coz she has givin' lice to me
you need a licence for that nobody has the right to be
givin out vd's and std's i mean i'm givin out disease
through my mp3's but shit
i don't care fuck a nike air
yo eko cut the track i'm the fuck outta here
i just want you to know nothing eva worries me


packin this third eye pursue a cyclops
they trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks
 words in my right that pass my left ear
your style is ass out like the bulls are next year 
fear this veneer you get stung like virgins
who that cat splurgin instead of rehearsin
tough guys degentrify your high rise
lookin more like ronald than them fuckin fry guys
go on uptown fuckin senoritas
in taco bell screamin "viva gorditas" 
bring all your dogs   i give em rabies
they never had a chance like my two aborted babies 
got pope john paul the 2nd prayin to satan
have your vegan girlfriend cookin up bacon
on barbituates with that shit that you hit
smoke my spliffs withcha cause spinal bifida


my nine is liftin ya six feet when i spray rounds
hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down
as eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
you lay down on a stretcher 
no pun intended just hop out of your whip
and leave it un attended before i whip out this gun and end it
unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
cause i can leave your infinite full of those even if someone's in it
snatch the airbag hit the corner and park it
corner the market i got her tied up in a chair and gagged
bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
like cavewomen while i'm gravediggin with marilyn man'

chorus: mr eon eminem

if you got a bowl of hash better cash it
you got a satchel flash it i'ma take your last hit
	and if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
	i'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'ma detach it
so if you got a bowl of hash you better cash it
you got a satchel flash it i'ma take your last hit
	i'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
	threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it


yo yo "eon's wack now" how you think that
couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap 
desecrate a crate with these rhymes i be totin
let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
i got stupid mucus from these loose lips
my loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
to the point that you stand up on your feet best retreat
let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
the quickening did a bris at the christening
i'm exercisin doing liftings and twistings
instinct's the nicest i keep tellin you
what the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin you 


 i'm e mailin you at the wrong website
and mispellin you prank you and put the fear of hell in you
escaped bellevue stuffed the nurse in a purse
disperse like i added too many words in a verse
slim shady a perverted version of birth
drivin off leaving a murdered virgin at church
the first person who searchin the earth for the motherfucker 
that pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
 get thrown curves and hit with your own words
leave me alone bitch  i get on my own nerves
and if i don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
i'm takin off both shoes and stickin each middle toe up


chorus


any disease out there i'm willin to catch it
slim shady
all praises to the high & mighty

outro: scratches by dj mighty mi

"slim shady" "naughty rotten rhymer"

i tried to come up with a speech that heat seeks
in a mans last stand with a heart that beats week
who each week turns on the tube to sneak peek
and see the same dude on a screen in repeats 
consider every word that i spit
every song on my albums a movie and this is the pilot
you're forced to eat rhymes and this a mere chapter of skills
and here after you'll feel the fear factor
a lone diver in flows and more liver in shows
with eye of the tiger like survivor
you seen it all before i just inherit the title emcee
now it's me your new american idol
without all of the bull or me in a seat rhyming
i'll fuck paula abdul and beat the shit out of simon
i'm not your big brother i'm joe millionaire
with your bitch throwing hundred dollar bills in the air


back to life 
back to reality 
back to the here and now 
back to life 
back to reality 
back to the here and now 


see i gotta change the channel in rap take it back as a hole
one of these rappers try to act as the mole
just an average joe or just a jackass
probably a bachelor with queer eye for straight ass
i'm no apprentice i landed a dream job
in a scene where each mob on the streets with teams rob
we don't live a simple life we live by road rules
til death do us part and the tools are old school
fuck elimidate i should start elimi fake emcee
who's career is just 1 big mistake cuz
this is the real world where you watch from cheap seats
weakest link's get killed over beats and defeats
2 of the best died they don't find no murder weapon
no suspects no taxi cab confession
no search star killers the faces glazed over
this entire case needs an extreme makeover 

bizarre: "don't touch that dial we'll be right back after these messages
you dirty filthy ass nasty son of a bitch"






i'm hot i don't stop when i'm taking a stand
and keep my pockets puffy like i'm making the band
won't be no trading spaces or even a change of heart
i don't use scare tactics i'll tear you apart
this is reality to make it though bootcamp
who wants to be a millionaire with a pocket of food stamps
you gotta see this for thirty seconds of fame
america's most wanted try and step in this game
they water down the show with these hooks that just rival
ozzy osbourne's speech when he needs a sub title
i'm not in it for fame or even the props
if i wasn't ripping mics you could find me on cops
being chased by hands of fans for autographs
and police who say i left them a trail of bloodbath
for killing instrumentals from snares & kicks now
to guitars & licks arrested and thrown in the big house



bizarre: "this has been a public service announcement from your man hush
and i'm bizarre from d 12 what the fuck
we about to shoot the club up i'm gone rock city
hush bizarre rap guys
hahahaha 2 rap guys i'm out" hi
 how you doin'
 how can i help you
 yeah i need to make a withdrawal
         *gun cocks* put the fucking money in the bag bitch and i won't kill you
 what oh my god don't kill me
 i'm not gonna kill you bitch quit fucking around
 don't kill me i have two kids at home
 i said i'm not gonna fucking kill you
 don't kill me
 hurry the fuck up *gunshot* thank you
 

i gotta keep this engine running 
pedal to the metal swifty better hurry up
'cause i ain't going back to jail
i don't wanna see my face up in newsweek
i'm sitting like a duck like tulley up in "blue streak"
what the fuck is taking so long

but i can't leave my homey  they all know me
i'm the jeff gord on of this bitch the cops can blow me
fuck who is that shit i'm getting nervous
staring out this dirty windshield for any persons
damn it's this bum cleaning with a squeegee

i hope they didn't ring the alarm 
swifty's gonna have to bomb and then it fucks up the job
but i don't care as long as we flee this place
'cause the last thing i need is a fucking police chase shit
cool here he comes i hope he's got the stash

yo there better be enough for me to get that maid back

 

put the money in the back bitch this is a stickup
anybody who moves is getting picked up off the ground
this is the sound this is how its going down
if i'm going down then you're going down 
now this is the plot: we pull this off then we split the pot
we get caught i'm peeling off the deal is off
but if we can pull this caper then we can get this paper
then i'm going off to tijuana
come on i'm ready if you are
 

 while i sit in the car chiefing
in the mood to be thieving this season
hey yo hush i'ma snatch what they 
pull over and i'ma rob this bitch for a purpose
you can either read it or see it

it'll work know what's worse
it's better than having to beat a bitch up out of her purse
i been pacing this bank patiently waiting
for the day they get up in this motherfucker
so don't drive away 
hey  nigga pop the trunk so i can grab the ak
and then i'm headed to the safe
i'm at the counter in the teller's face
"yo if anybody move i'ma make spaghetti out of your wife" 
i hopped a gate shot a citizen
after he gave me the combination to open it

ruff ryders
motherfuckers  
say that i'm foolish i only talk about jewels 
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
see i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
that same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin
what i do through and through and
i give you the news   with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade; you been afraid
i penetrate pop culture bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
no he's not around   now how that sound to ya jot it down
i bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
i help them see they way through it   not you
can't step in my pants can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt


since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits i'll wear it
but if it don't then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
but there's a huge interference   they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin drug addict   like you didn't experiment
now now that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin do gooders   too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here i don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
cause here we go   he's 
and i'm the sinister mr kiss my ass it's just the


 renegade  never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
cause i'm a renegade  never been afraid to talk
about anything  anything  renegade
 never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
cause i'm a  never been afraid to holler
about anything  anything 


i had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lot of lint not a cent
gotta vent lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
whatchu hollerin gotta pay rent bring dollars in
by the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
doo rag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
do not step to me   i'm awkward i box leftier often
my pops left me an orphan my momma wasn't home
could not stress to me i wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor   thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much only raisin green up
raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky
big i did it   multi before i die 
no lie just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight


see i'm a poet to some a regular modern day shakespeare
jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and satan a scatter brained atheist
but that ain't the case see it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter   a gateway to escape
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see it's easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie
while i'm wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics
in holy water   no wonder they try to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
the new ice cube   motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do  i'm just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers cause i'm a muh'fuckin

but don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
like it's supposed to be scarin me
like i won't leap clean over this fuckin vip rope and throw this chair
at anyone close or near me tryna approach me physically
cause he don't spit lyrically
and he knows that my flow's so sick this hoe's on my dick
and he's so sick of hearin me my posters is starin at him

of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
if i go hysterically; cause i guarantee

any quicker than i would or hit you with plywood
especially when i'm sippin on this liquor and tonic

in a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
choose to translate it through the art of music
and started usin it reachin the youth influenced by the truth in it 
and as a boy a man i ran from boys in vans
do the knowledge acknowledge and try to comprehend
hand full of contraband
a product of my environment narcotics and violence
inspires the content but my intent is
to retire these tired ass writers in si lence 
cause haters they hate us cause shady became famous
and claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless 
but racist accusations won't change us
let the truth be told you think o will be over here

anybody knows us know this not how we roll

i wouldn't have been such a prick to you fuckin men
you say you don't trust 'em
why do i hear the sound of toilets flushin some shit is goin down
you must've just not have been truthful from the start

fuckin see why they call this bullshit a relationship ships sink
and you know it's love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
and it feels like every time i fuckin do i get jinxed
cupid must've put a curse on me six weeks
have went by and we only spoke twice
i'm sittin in your driveway callin you from the car suffice
i think it's safe to say you're not at home
i'm callin your cell phone you answer but i can tell though that you're not alone
how was i to know
it should've been time to go a long time ago; i kept holdin on
it's comical when i think back now why i couldn't get the hint
you feel the draft you were thrown i wasn't catchin your drift
but there's a cold breeze blowin over me i'm over you
success is the best revenge to pay you back and that payment is overdue
i overcame odds to get even
the sober me is shittin all over the un sober you

i'm hauntin you bitch everywhere you turn i'm followin you
cause i loved you with every ounce of me you know it's true

your options are leave or get put out granted your ass fine
but fine just ain't gon' cut it drama's what you're in love with
you and your bitches you run with lately i'm feelin smothered
you snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
conceited with cover girl motives i gotta rise above it
you think them models lovin me i'm thinkin 'bout who doesn't
doesn't really matter what you say sickness in my stomach
told you i was gon' be splittin you don't think i mean it
meant through with everything that i got fuck you ain't no secret
no apologies you keep it now that i'm doin my thing and you peep it
the badder times all outweigh the recent
your energy who needs it every rumor you hear you go believe it
point out the times you seen it you stabbed me should've linked it
revenge is mine i need it need a way out
it's my fuckin life let her find a way to stay out
bet you thought i'd break it ain't that easy
bet you thought i'd need you a million times before you need me
leave me everything that i gave to you ain't no freebies get your coat and go
the female pinocchio money hungry hopeless hoe

love is like a cancer when you don't let go 
i'ma blow for sho' unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
i don't need you sinkin us hope you float
lyin through my teeth i hope you don't 
now the sound of that be dope bottles pop hourly smoke

lloyd banks  ha ha


it's like a throne that he don't even own
he won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
it's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
he don't want the diamonds want the gold or want the jewelry
he don't want the room and he don't want the loot he's in it for the sport
runnin circles 'round his competition on the court
he appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
and you can love and you can hate it
but you can't ignore it you can't be that ignorant
but you can try to sell him short
but you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
and he was born to raise hell like them country boys
and if i'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

chizzle town thugs in the club like chicks posin'
lambchop niggaz is sheep in wolf clothing

double o 3 long time no see
who mind parts seas and cause blind to see
some think this industry is just all rhyme and g
then he make it to the door and he can't find the key
don't know what it be to make y'all follow my lead
or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed
if rap wasn't rap no more what would it be
i don't know i'd be zonin' sometime must be the weed that's that shit




yeah homicide housing loose linx
carlton fisk dc rest in peace
to the million dollar kid y
 sick eyes size 7

girl don't waste that swallow it all 
we just some dogs we just some dogs


by any means necessary it's on
bitch your fucking with a dog all i wanna do is bury some bones
take a piss on a tree and i'm gone girlfriend don't get it wrong
i hate to be the one to shit on your lawn but i ain't got my dog license
i ain't nothing nice and i ain't never met a piece of pussy i ain't liking
sugar and spicing kicked up with ice and you can do anything with these hoes
except housewife them like snoop said "it ain't nothing but a g thing" 
got a bitch in my bed in nothing but a g string so peep game
who the lucky female to taste these snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh
you're messing with me i'm messing with you i'm a dog trick
i chase cats like peppy la pu dead on shit
my life's like a holiday inn if my girl act up
i'm gunna fuck her friend if i'm a what




i'm a dog motherfucker i walk on all fours
find where you live at shit on your porch redman is hungry
don't leave the food out i'm pumped like a pamela anderson boob job
straight up bulldog mixed with a shizhsu
cause i bullshit party a little bit
swim with the shark you're bound to drown
my weed is like green and yours brown
the doctor the dog from cali to georgia
when cats meow with noting on top they halter
i don't have yemen that laugh when i laugh
we some dogs we can kiss our own ass
like a golden retriever retrieving the chronic
the dose nose bitch and no need to hide it   redman a flirt
always get my nuts stuck to the porch like the dog on joe dirt





fish don't fry in the kitchen bitch don't climb keep bitching
beans don't burn on the grill 3 4 5
with the pimping hoes get your pimps permission
now pay attention the big d o double to the g o
to the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some vo 
and mix it with some pena colidino
then slip it on the bitch then i dip with all her c notes

the way you chew that bubble gum the way you sucking a dick
and i can tell that you a freak
i wanna stick some dick up in you can i skeet skeet
don't you know why

 
on the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind


just gonna stand there and watch me burn
well that's alright because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
well that's alright because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie ohhhh
i love the way you lie


now there's gravel in our voices
glasses shatter from the fight
in this tug of war you'll always win
even when i'm right
cause you feed me fables from your head
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied




ohhhhhhhh ohhh
so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run but i don't wanna ever leave
'til the walls are goin up
in smoke with all our memories


this morning you wake a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
 hush baby speak softly tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby without you i'm nothing i'm so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly i am but that you'll always love me
then after that shove me in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs cause we're that lucky
together we move mountains
let's not make mountains out of molehills you hit me twice yeah but who's countin
i may have hit you three times i'm startin to lose count
but together we'll live forever we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy we're nuts but i refuse counselin
this house is too huge if you move out i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground ain't shit you can do about it
cause with you i'm in my fuckin mind without you i'm out it~




i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie slim shady 


well i do pop pills i keep my tube socks filled
and pop the same shit that got tupac killed
spit game to these hoes like a soap opera episode
and punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes
there's three things i hate: girls women and bitches
i'm that vicious to walk up and drop kick midgets
they call me boogie night the stalker that walks awkward
stick figure with a dick bigger than mark wahlberg
comin through the airport sluggish walkin on crutches
hit a fuckin  in her  with luggage
it's like a dream i can't snap out i black out and back out
i'm lookin for someone "of" to beat the crap "out"
i'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers

i had a huge attitude started off staticky
mad at you had you mad at me automatically 
i'm not a commodity i'm an oddity
who oddly enough developed himself a halloween following
it's so big if i counted up all the freaks who follow me
i'd probably owe ozzy osbourne an apology
college girls live in an alcoholic's world
full of earl head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
covered in throw up and i refuse to grow up
i won't budge i still tell a grown up to shut up 
i made this rap game suspenseful cause now i got a impulse
to give you insults wrote with a pencil 
and waste the paper on you choppin down the oakwood
cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
and as long as i stay in the studio and keep cuttin
you motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin

strapped to beds pipe bombs dynamite lead
money power respect street cred yeah
it's scary ain't it picture yourself goin out as a hero 
picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many biggie backed off of 
biggie's back and 'pac's landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re enact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march 9th
to come from such hard knock lifes
and make it up out of 'em hit the spotlights
and once they're on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest 
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
it's origin which is usually originated from cats who starvin
or it could just be somebody's horror that just horri fies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou rage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that he's gangster
he ain't just say shit you just believe it

  
since bib taught us niggaz to think big
i'm been about my business since then so anxious 
it ain't how we live it's what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious i'm experiencin the same sights as him
it's what excited obie to write these poems
rollin goin through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
when _ready to die_ was a sick part of my life 
palmin that forty five plottin to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican i'd so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly i'd be popular huh 
that's the inspiration i got from my nigga bi

  
i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passin 
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and i'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddy's honor i'm a father t'yanna
and teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
on repeat all of your albums play back to back 
and i visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
an immaculate concept extravagant progress
bullet wounds left in my heart i'm yellin "god bless"
regardless to critics yellin that east/west
i seen the game losin i'm just pressin the reset 
and when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally

cream with the pliers like  only a ruthless bastard would do this
take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to ruth's chris
give her toothpicks and stop on the way home pick up two big bufords
scrupulous girl you got a nice pair but you're plum stupid
so when i pull up in that benz don't try to pretend you ain't interested
to impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
and get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
if you should get dick pretend like it's a musical instrument
you get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
i can tell at first glance you're a hoe cause your pants are so
tight when you dance with o trice your implants explode
so cold to dykes the chance of snow in san francisco
well i'm from detroit city you live in animosity
that's a fucked up state to be in such an atrocity
look where these random thoughts get me it's senseless mind babble

somewhere in the caribbean islands
cause the vibe you giving me now
feels like i'm an innocent child
sinning is never tempting when other womens around

our intimacy is significantly different

any problem we can see it through

we ain't even got to talk when we see each other
we got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers

who needs a label we roll hand in hand
visions of you having my little man
we joke you call me george foreman
cause i'm namin him o number four me i'm three
plus the ol' g like the personality she say it's meant to be
i'm in the bathroom when you pee
she in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo you my boo boo
there's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
satisfy   this my bitch that ride
my bitch wit the pistol in the ride
a nigga act up she busting she ain't got to decide
no discussion she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
you're fucking wit her husband




come on and think about it
you got a ring about it
nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
drama we overcome it if we out numbered
i promise it'll be us against a hundred
rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
eight months later obie rubbing your stomach
paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
enough to call o her baby father
you ain't gotta bother bout a deal i swear i keep it real
raise young o trill and cook a decent meal
it's signed and sealed you the only female
hail my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
post bail and post up for sale

long as i got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
who's gon stop up nobody we's that deal

then i'm gon stand by you 
if you promise you'll be true
then i'll never put my hands on you 
but don't you play me for no fool  bitch

hey lady hey darlin' hey baby
i'm sorry but i can't be your boyfriend
if you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
i'll kill you
bitch i'm fuckin'
for real i'll make you suffer like i suffered
if you fuck me then i'll make you fall in love


hey lady 
i don't think you really wanna be my girl 
fuckin' with me can be dangerous 
you never what i might really be like 
in your life  i'm the type 
that might flip and get a little bit crazy


baby i'm extra large  in magnitude
and magnums to lubrication that i use
to chose which hole on a ho i abuse 
have 'em confused can't tell who is who
when i fuck the shit out you then the next date 
i rush the shit out you off my two way 
you wanna cuddle emotional hustle up on pocono's
poke ya nose in and outta obie's own
no i'm in and out your home
and this in and out your tone
i ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around 
i bounce 'em around
camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
how that sound
if i was in love witcha now you wanna clown
fuck with them clowns until i pound on your crown
bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
you don't want it with me you just horny as me
you want a nut nuttin' but what is you be


i'm internationally known baby but actually
there are few people who know how i am naturally
all you know is that i can act irrationally
when you shove a puppet up in my face on national tv
so they label me this crazed loony rap bully
but truthfully that ain't the truth
and if you believe in that shit
then you'll believe anything's true
and you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
but personally that actually works for me
cuz the last thing that i need's a string attached to me
i'ma bachelor bitch and i ain't in no fast fury
to run out and find a new mrs mathers
cuz see technically me and kim ain't back fully
but we do still make booty calls occasionally
but be damned if i end up back in that pattern
and we end up back at that god damn tavern
and havin' another déjà vu we seein' security
pass my pussy around like it's ja rule's jewelry
i got news for you bitch your news curfew's early
you ain't home by 2:30  you heard me


hey lady hey darlin' hey baby
i'm sorry but i can't be your boyfriend
if you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
i'll kill you
bitch i'm fuckin'
for real i'll make you suffer like i suffered
if you fuck me then i'll make you fall in love


hey lady hey lady
i don't think you really wanna be my girl

fuckin' with me can be dangerous 
you never know what i really 




see you lookin' at the life you lookin' at the lights 
you lookin' at the ice  you ain't lookin' at the trice 
you should look at some advice when i say he ain't nice 
despite the fact you think you the feisty type
o love to fight  i love the drama 
love when my bitch get to cussin' out yolanda 
find the obie condom on the counter
swingin' her weave can't breathe like i can't believe
least i ain't deceieve and try to mislead
and sell a dream just to get you on my team
i came clean to keep down the beef
keep down my reach you can keep all your teeth


what we do under the covers should stay between the covers
and the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
on the front page cover of "us" as new lovers
and this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors
cuz the truth of it everything that i do's public
and you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
guess who you just screwed as soon as me and you've done it
and save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
but i guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
but you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
cuz you never know when the shoe
could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you
cuz you think you want it then you want me then you get me
then you got me and you're fucked cuz you'll be stuck with me
for the rest of your life cuz if i get attached to you
we'll be joined at the hip i'll be so latched to you
you'll be walkin' out the house and i'll run up and tackle you
chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
you don't think you're leavin' this house in that do you
not till i brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
and have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
front on me never
cuz we gonna be together forever
right bitch 
right bitch 


hey lady hey darlin' hey baby
i'm sorry but i can't be your boyfriend
if you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
i'll kill you
bitch i'm fuckin'
for real i'll make you suffer like i suffered
if you fuck me then i'll make you fall in love


hey lady 
i don't think you really wanna be my girl 
fuckin' with me can be dangerous

only let's me know that i'm loved 
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
and is bomb as you keep fuckin with us we keep fuckin you up
and keep pullin the rug from up under you
and what's even more fucked up is we enjoy what were doin
so much there ain't nothin that we love more than pullin your skirts up
and exposin you hoes so much people are startin to wonder
what's up with them fuckin one dough a man under rules
do on to others as you will have done under you
so who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
when someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you 
you gonna ask yourself how come your mans 
didn't enter that last round that he had in curtis jackson's ass while he had the chance
you keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
this is past any rationalization
we have captured national media attention
conversation is senseless you can sense the tension start buildin
soon as we enter the '106th & park' building
someone's gonna get killed and i swear to god 
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
i'll put a million on his head
and you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
but i'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
and it ain't because i'm a bitch
it's because i ain't a bitch i don't endanger people that i'm with
i'm a general i ain't bush i don't send my soldiers to war
if i ain't there in the middle of the shit with 'em so when i do get 'em
orders to storm your headquarters you'll be fuckin with a 


fuckin with a piece keeper see you a nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver
that'll eat ya niggaz wanna keep speakin like it ain't even that deep
i got heat that'll sweep a nigga street 
see i wouldn't fuck with me neither only heaven can help ya
i'll be searchin for you longer than the "legend of zelda"
without a failure there's gonna be hell to tell the
captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya

pushin crack vows young nino brown
chasin green is the dream when your young and brown
bound to be a problem child look what i'm involved in now
a 'dozen dirty' niggaz and they all get down
dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
when revolvers we said "all men get out"

i'm handlin chumps packin a pump
that's longer than the elephant trunk 
on the streets i'm a beast i feast upon the weak
so speak beef i'll shot you and scream "increase the peace"
a monster pistol packin pushin niggaz off they hondas
stomp ya get it crackin yankin bitches for they ganja
sneaky as fuck i don't think mama beat me enough
when she was sleep and stuff i was stealin the keys to the truck
shut the fuck up before you end up dead in the dump truck
or in the streets takin a nap bleedin and lumped up
who want what like m bleek with this heat if you ten deep
then fuck it it will be ten sleepin 


don't muscle with my a land ski
don't tustle with my hand speed
clutch your burner bust it and watch your man bleed
we ferocious toast no holsters

we the soldiers y'all the youngsters 
youngsters lungs puncture dead in a dumpster 
upstairs the munster hand full of drama
you scared of the drama bomber the monster 
i'm back nigga  i reappear

blackness carcass covered with cat fish
we murkers with no purpose other than practice 


there's three things i hate: liars fakes and cheaters
alcoholics sluts and fuckin wife beaters
a gat that describes my life 
i don't even know who song this is 
bitch bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop

to own their own label and give the game up
some niggaz came up some just didn't

some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
so they can act up feel comfortable and rap tough
and that's as backwards cuz them niggaz just gone keep coming back
and that's when extortion happens
you struggle to get free i know how this shit be

who you got in your ear  i don't even gotta say it the fans know
quit tryin to be tough nigga you look like a asshole




they say why don't we increase the peace
the only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
cuz niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
till that 4 5 will cease the speech
yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
could've reached the peep now you're left with a horrible leak
i'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle

and make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
poverty make your ass bet on words

i'm in the white mink the fabric is done
got rings like mike bird magic and them
out of dallas to the palace where the mavericks is from
living lavish i'm established so the cabbage'll come

got glocks for sale red tops for sale
anything you need believe me i'm gon lace you
just don't whatever you do snitch
cause you will get hit pray i don't lace you yeah


it's risky the bitch tend to rise out a nigga
it's history snitch who decided he's a member
once he got pinched coincided with law
same homie say he lay it down for the boy
brought game squad around ours
how could it be been homies since superman draws
only foniness never came to par
he had us a true neighborhood actor
had his back with k's
now we see through him like x ray's
cuffed in that adam car
no matter his loss we at him it's war
knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs
you helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable
when we invest in team it's to the death fo sho
no ex and oh's tex calicos
aim at your chest nicca




we started out as a crew when one speak it's all honest
private conferences when we eat benihana's
reconnaissance when we peep enemies on us
been on these corners sellin like anything on us
knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors
but that ain't got shit to do with the tea in china
we gon keep the grind up til death come find us
meantime leaning in them european whips reclined up
it's eye for an eye for the riders
we ain't trying to get locked up we soul survivors
po po's is cowards there's no you it's ours
we vow this mixing yayo with soda powder
who woulda known he would fold and cower
once the captain showed he sold whole mcdonalds
so no exs and ohs tex calicos
aim at your chest nicca




nowadays sammy da bull's got the game full
so he move to a rural area to keep cool
he snitchin on a snitch now there's nothin to tell
nowadays your circles should be small as hell
ain't tryin to meet new faces this don't interest me
even if we bubble slow we'll get it eventually
no penitentary there will be no climacy
you will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century
these cats is rats now the streets need decon
that's how they react now weak when the heat's on em
stop snitchin you asked for the life your living
this act is not permitted nowhere on the map it is
forbidden to send a nigga to prison if you been in it
along with em and then snitch and become hidden
so it's no exs and ohs techs calicos
aim at your chest nicca




you rat bastard
yeah
ay em you ready
herc you got them thangs nigga 
detroit city


there they go them d town boys carry the calico
whenever there's war you gotsta know
them boys got toys tear down the front door
detroit make noise everywhere that we go
there they go there they go


you are not convincing
when detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
niggaz get popped for instance infrared dot for distance
get knocked by the cops cop on some pen shit
straight detention a nigga doing tension
once released he on that music buisness
when viewing 106 and them cafeterias
only to find that rap's actually serious
deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
same shit that sent em upper michigan
us is pimping a difference from any city i visited
it's that detroit spirit and if we in it balling out till the ending period
use o as a reference to that sentence
the message i'm sending you best just pay attention




if you don't like how i act then blow me
i don't really give a shit i represent the real cats who know me
man what's up with that scratch you owe me
now run my chips before we fall out like shaq and kobe
big herc on a track with obie when you come to the d
it's cut throat better be packing homie
and niggaz get they shit split for acting phonie
we're known for the glocks and the choppas
these niggaz'll rob you leave you standing in ya socks and ya boxers
we got real g's and lots of imposters
i smoke the real trees see i cop from the rastas
ya'll niggaz ain't impress me yet
ya'll yapping not rapping turn that shit off and press eject
see we known for the car shows running from the narcos
keep them bottles coming we gon pop em till the bar close




meat cleaver leave a gas in a bitches ass
see her dreams of being an r&b singer diva
leave her face cut her from the waist
ah man what a waste of a pretty face
and this place ain't just safe it's just straight gangsta
it ain't just new york or la that pains no more
there's latin coun' kings here
southside four east side and gansen
nuthin but ganglands and spray paint cans
and when that van rolls up man they ain't glancing
that window rolls down and that tre eight's dancing
and them shooters don't miss homie they hate chancing
straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashing
red and blue lights no ambulance you got flattened
and this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
but just so ya know if ya see them d boys passing




here we go motherfuckers

don't even dream of fucking up in detroit bitch
this is where the real killers at

gold diggin bitches the buck stops here 
the road to riches is closed for repair
so if the shoe ain't fittin girl leave that shit alone
you aint erykah badu what i look like tyrone
i rip your tissue out your ear

yo that's it i don't plan shit you know how we go down
they need to slow down and take a look who the hoe now

tryin to roll up on miami leavin with a broke neck
oh shit leathal lyric equal land mind
i be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
and i'm buck wild exposin the plain truth
you couldn't mess with me fuckin shit up in the same room
hey you i don't know you but fuck it let me get a dollar
for this bad car that go along with the breath
some show the mad bomb and steal the show like a theft
cause in miami the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 





some people say i'm strange i tell them ain't shit change
i'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
became late to the last show with a different dane
brain ate from the last ode that i snifed the cane
yo know your spaced the fuck out like george lucas
when your pukus turnin to yellow with orange mukus
so when i grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
i'm not a rapper i'm a demon who speaks english
freak genuis too extreme for the weak and squeemish
burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
cause when i drop the science motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
start a fire and block the hydrants
i'm just a mean person you never seen worse than
so when slim gets this m 16 burstin
you gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin  
on the b side of my first single with the clean version
stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
in the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
to try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
i'll take it back before we knew each others name
run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
i'll take it further back than that
back to lovers lane to the night you were started 
cock block your fathers game 
i'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
so suck my dick while i take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
and when i'm down with ten seconds left then to hope out
i'ma throw a head but so hard i'll knock us both out


bust your lip rush ya clique what

yo i'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
is a crime in a sense climbing a fence
diagonally bent dying in agony in a magically event
outz in a fear of family presents
capped in clak smoke pack toast in a black coat
to roast motherfuckers over lactose 
stay skeed off laced weed
i take cheese and page trees in the bricks
rolling box of tracies

right off the top then go back to the top

write it down on the paper 
and still be able to read it 
i can't read but i still write to my pen pals 
i can't fly but i still float on cement clouds 
i can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out

some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
lauryn huh  hill

*beat stops*

now don't make me write some real shit nigga

this my last letter right here
fuck this world lets get the fuck outta here


i put my soul through the ink
bless a path with thoughts at my thoughts
before i grow extinct
my back bone disowned by zone
why roam called home
but now on i'm all alone
just proof no shine no friends just fans
no wonder my hands tight where the internet ends
i take back most of the flack
the stress smokes press me close to the crack
like my pops the ghost of my past
thyme and mudd jay dee and stuckey
lately i'm lucky i don't hate me to touch me
maybe i'm ugly inside but smiling to make it
i love y'all dawg and that's how ever you take it
the fame is an illusion i'm still losing
in this game with the rules and
i feel clueless the streets with the hills blue less
cops knocking at the door got me looking real foolish
but i still do this like i love it even though i thug it
keep flossing lights in public the subject y'all don't know
stars won't grow who would dream that scars would show
minus the mtv videos with slim
"up in smoke" d 12 and many shows with em
it's still me dawg no change for change
it's strange when it pours it rains
i take it back


i wish i could take it back i wish i could take it back
but it's too late
i wish i could take it back i wish i could take it back
but it's too late


always talking to snuk hopin' he speak back
wishin' my first son was here to reach at
feeling detached
my brother earl and wayne that bail money for jail y'all can keep  that
i've been deep before ask stillman
my hearts melting tell the truth i need help man
i hearts big but by sins bigger
fuck the world i don't feel like i can win niggaz
it's like i'm lost and i find only demons
i wanna quit its like i'm tired of breathing
so my stress confess to a famous song
em i love you don't let this money change us dawg
1st born when i'm gone grab the sign
leave naeem with the cream and his mom
and dear mamma i use to hate you
now i relate to everything you did to make proof
i love you
take it back




all y'all see is free from 106 and park
y'all don't know i risk my heart with this apart
from the streets the groups the friends the foes
the jewels the dick lickers and the hoes
what about me
sheltered with no guidance
look at the finest royal highness on some hot shit
still living with the liquor and bud
sometimes i wish for my demise so i can kick it with bugz
i wish it was real between us all
in the past you should of seen us dawg
i die for em and save hailie brave maybe
but just let them tears roll off my grave shady
kuniva n' swift how live does it get
i meant to teach y'all niggaz to survive in this bitch
if we die to be rich that makes me happy
and on another note shit don't hate me pappy
it's just that we look the same you let the game take you
your son game along and took the game
since i took my own life y'all feel a killa fo sho
bizarre on the real you the realest nigga i know
strapping and busting ain't real just tell your mans the truth
and that's why you've always been friends with proof
answer to all i've always lied with truth
and before i pull the trigger denaun i'm proud of you


aiyyo she a freak and i love the way she move to the beat

you get slapped that way you can't dodge the drama
i'm pimpin aunts and mamas i collect from massage parlors 
menage a trois is really second nature

and uh i can give a fuck about a relation
either open your legs or get the play stupid bitch




hey you know i gotta say somethin on this track

well i'm not a pimp or a player see i'm more like the mayor
grab a bitch up by her hair like i just don't care
and swing her in the air  i'm talkin major ass kick
toss a bitch out the house like kwame kirkpatrick
i'm a pimp so i give a fuck about a bitch
but i don't make 'em trick i'm rich 
i don't need the chips they don't walk the strip
but i could spit some game and i could talk some shit
i'm somethin like a pimp similar to a mack

ooh hey ooh hey ooh hey
ooh hey ooh hey 
all these niggaz talkin 'bout what they gon' kill
heard you caught a misdemeanor then i heard you squeal
holdin hands with the da while you made your deal
three thousand miles away and i could hear you still
half these niggaz snitchin yo and that's for real
i know it's hard to swallow that's a big ol' pill
if i catch you motherfuckers you gon' catch some steel
i know it might sound crazy that's the way i feel


uhh trace this to it's basis no movie script
no yay no pounds no uzi clips
not a car no bling know a bougie bitch
you got all of these rappers sayin they movin bricks
they whole cliques switch with boob and tits
if you're   truly bitch then they'll   usually snitch
in a roundabout way i say my toolies spit
but if it come to coppin a plea it includes the fifth
the mood is flipped cause spirits see the diaphragms
gangsta rappers with murderers for hired hands
police and riot vans callin us pirate clans
government guide hands with private plans
to damage the game it's a shame to survive a scam
cause we high off liquor bitches and vicadin
yell out we gon' strike again so triflin
got kids idlin the vest to riflin 
why you make a fake life in pens
glorify the hood but never a bible hymn
and as the streets keep tyin in
until the feds indict the fans just for buyin in where's the violin




hah are you the guy that told the guy that i'm the guy that gave the guy
a half a p; now the police is after me
askin me questions tellin me shit you only knew
pulled up on me out the blue all this shit because of you
watch to do somethin cool bitch snitchin like samuel bull
now yo' life's fucked up and i'm announcin you responsible
and i'm cut the fuck up and whatchu gonna do but sit yo' ass there
so what  ain't nothin fair
when a nigga like you get carried away without your lips
and they wonderin why swifty mcvay be killin shit 
i drop you off and get lost come back the same day
witcho' tongue cut off nigga it's cursed anyway
you the one who can't count so give my g's up 
and when it comes to shootin you the one who freeze up
that's why yo' broke ass could swallow these nuts
and folks ask tryna follow everything that reads up
on your report you made i will escort you to your grave
tryna see me behind bars so you can get paid
that's negative you threaten my life  i can't let you live
then you think that it'll catch up to your momma and your kids snitch 




if you aim for slugs that's blazed by killers
now the game done changed these niggaz out here praisin squealers
go proof   my behavior's iller when tellin the truth
expunge my gun nigga like any paid felon'll do
my spoken is well in the truth you in hell and the proof
from the block to the jail or the booth
bod boy image shall illuminate in silence
gangsta one that communicates through violence
go proof   not through yappin or hostile rappin
all on tv vest up and glocks go flashin
it's all actin   y'all just
don't see the director behind the camera that yells out "action" 
blowin off the door hinge to a world in orbit
where the masses have supportive recorded performance
there's enormous shortage of poor kids
with new deals they will become distorted and tortured
and i ain't losin like 'pac there's rules on my block
i'm from detroit bitch it ain't cool to be shot 


  





heh aiyyo dig this
if you tell the masses you tell the cops
but if that street yappin made you famous then you a star
star; hey write down "star"
write down "star" on a piece of paper
hold it up in front of you right in the mirror
put it in the mirror
hold it up in front of you and that's you
we don't like you 
holla at me fix it faggots
it's however it's whatever you like
if you that nigga tryna get ahead and you know you right
i see the henny and i guess it's aight
cause it ain't have the bars then take a step of your life


yeah i stepped out the background when my nigga dilla left
didn't see the full picture maybe just a rough sketch
didn't know the dude for real they knew a silhouette
small portion who i was when i turned and looked back
had a few tools had to learn to work that
plus they cut a nigga out say i wasn't worth jack
the trials of your man i'm not complainin
i'm sayin the truth y'all exactly how it's layin
so when you see me don't think it was easy
things wasn't fair to me your man t threezy
i had to work to eat i wasn't supposed to be
i did a flow like boats on seas
now i'm the captain of my own destiny
i stand at the edge of this shit control my feats
i rearrange things that could've remained bleak
cause you ain't doin the same don't mean you should hate me




damn it's hard hustlin with your crew
when you the head of your troops and dudes don't wanna grow up
attitude is so what nig's out here killin 'em
dude's draggin his feet i ain't got time to deal with him
look at the time dime how many years it's been
since we moved back from brooklyn
you lookin sorry dawg pardon me i'm your mans this ain't no diss
but i don't see no good in you if you don't handle yo' biz
yo' angle is is bored and stubborn
quick to say fuck whoever and still want somethin for nothin
streets talked about your loose lips remember when proof flipped
threw a cassette tape at you you ain't do shit
exactly i woulda been scrappin if that was me
when the feds came to swoop you turned your back on t
i ain't sayin you snitch but your actions are smellin like fish
you still smackin your bitch too old to be actin like this
man chill




i ain't tryin to find no blame or make excuses
i figured y'all slept so long i'll wake the rooster
i love hip hop and just makin music
in the "8 mile" flick i was portrayed as future
on the set i was due where's the rest of my crew
for the movie this is truly our destiny dude
i'm like shady is my team maybe it's a dream
it seems i'm bein choked like radio raheem
p knew it when g unit all got deals
imagine a muscle have to hustle that's why it feel
i'm walkin out of different people office still
this ain't a diss this is just talkin real
toy soldier wonderin how they coffin feel
my homie put me on 'em but i got up off them pills
got a boss appeal you can call me malphie
but ask 'em all how where the fuck what they'd be without me   proof


dirty harry is dead 
i'm here to announce that dirty harry is dead
now witness the life of his son or oil can harry the boss


my life is trapped in these lines that's why i'm packin' these nines
i gotta rap i ain't dyin' that's in the back on my mind
got a strap made of iron can't relax on this grind
bendin' over backwards for these slackers til i'm snappin' my spine
naturally i gotta focus
on these bogus poachers lookin' over my shoulder proof get it poppin' like soda
hold up
 
slow up
 
roll up
 
if em say it i spray it if he willin' i kill it
we kill packs to get iller detroit y'all can feel it
got this gun on my wasteline in war we don't waste time
ja man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
we got school craft here at the 7 8 and text her
i'm up in holly spendin' dollas ain't feelin' no pressure
yes sir your texture is bitch bet'cha ya flinch
when proof shoot up they coup and wet your whole clique

you'll be next to big pac is destiny kid
before ya lead get popped stop testin' me bitch


homie you think you tough 
think we won't fuck you up 
even the innocent get pistol whipped by this pistol grip 
talkin' shit you drunk

we both deep i ain't scared and i don't give a fuck 


i ain't feel no games homie don't even try
we ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot 
heart of fire soul of ice roll the dice see what you get
no advice all my life i ain't leavin' in this bitch
i'm a man more i'm holdin' my ground
to loadin' these rounds at any call approachin' my ground 
i'm a kid but grimey nothin' but killas
and behind me i'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
if i was to crush 'em got to say these bibles are nothin'
this rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
i fight for my cousins that ain't even related
even i stated not from life i leave you bleedin' and faded
hatin' made in my nature i'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status ya livin'
flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
after these rappers' status
to shadders knowin' proof and that mathers has gathered an army
it's shady bandatas
after rest the game is won who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
the name that some forgot d12 it ain't hard to feel guard ya grill it's real


welcome back to the stage of history


yo slim shady
yo i'll fuckin i'll
i'll puke eat it and freak you 
battle  i'm too weeded to speak to
the only key that i see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
i'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse  
you'll think i pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
 i ain't no fuckin g i'm a cannibal 
i ain't tryin to shoot you 
i'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
wrap you in rope and plastic stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
coke and acid black magic cloaks and daggers 
fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis
i'm so bananas i'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while i sit back and just hope it catches 
blow you to fragments
laugh roll you and smoke the ashes

chorus: j black 

i see the light at the end
but every time i take a step it gets dim
tell me is this hell we're livin in
if so heaven's got to be better
but if we're hellbound whatever let's go down


am i the worst  because i never go to church 
i run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
i'ma drink 'til my liver rot see the doc
leave the er then hit a bar for a liquor shot 'til the liver spot
one day we all gon' die
but when i die i'ma be so high
that i'ma get up and walk leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
i smoke 'til i choke and i sex a lot
i got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
now if i pray everynight 
do i still have to hold my trey very tight
you feel me god  i done did so much shit while on earth
i smoke i drink i curse and to make matters worse
i bust my gun first and then i chat with your corpse
since way back i was one to never like back talk
see me at the pearly gates in line wearin a north face
nickle nine at my waist god done lost faith
angels greet me but i don't reply back
just show me to my quarters and oh yeah where's thai at

chorus 1/2


maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
final battle fight


analyze the strength of my game like lee corso
call me a lost soul with a vest on my torso
and of course yo y'all know i'm no stranger to danger
like christ in a manger feel a whole range of my anger
i breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
and beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
my pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger walk with a swagger
tie your wife to the back of a black jag and i drag her
ten blocks untie the bitch and i still bag her
give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
my shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
my flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
everyday i grow more older and more colder
fly you to colorado roll you over with a boulder
i know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

chorus


but every time i take a step it gets dim
tell me is this hell we're livin in
haha

put four in your head have you floatin off in a river

sippin dom perignon while she sippin up them newborns
yeah bet ya hate the news holmes 
he probably somewhere sippin on a stoop huh
sippin on a brew plottin to pop me later huh 
when will a hater learn i'm too great on a song
i push weight on the corner send weight to the coroner
when courage make him turn performer
i transform into uma therman a dude's version
verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose 
continue to walk this earth's surface
i was birthed in hip hop watch out my services 
yet you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
from the same turf as you's  what nerve of you's 
pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit 
i'm gettin rich i'm on my way to hugh hefner's dig
with a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big 
on another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live 
know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
i'm state to state in that honda nigga not an accord 
i'm in that honda g4 you would never afford 
and yep it's probably ease when a nigga is on board


 cry now
 cry now
 cry now
 nigga cry now


i'll be damned if i let a nigga lay his hands on me
i'll lay his ass out and park a grand am on him
the city where the weak survive and the strong die
where beef collide shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
i done seen the worst of the worst   and what can be worse
than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
the streets is like a curse niggaz frontin for a bitch
it's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
a part of my heart is gone i can never smile the same
trigger finger is itchy it'll take a while to tame
detroit is hella dirty but the dozen can fix it
resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
and bounce off one's home hit and ricochet
off a kid's trombone right to where you niggaz lay
obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
i shed tears but you can get your fill of it today




yo obie they gonna fuck with us this time nigga

witness the art of war in the physical 
since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical 
and no words from ca$h mouth is fiction 
ready to throw clips if i'm never dissin you
my aura awards raw to the core and the surface
of the street when i walk through the door my purpose
is to move up pull towards you purp'in
watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
plot of bin laden soul of mumia
i'm prayin to proof i'm searching for jerry garcia
talk to my brother gone in the streets of the d
i'm totin the k at hawk niggaz waitin on me
you take the first shot then second round's on me
and when you walk on the other side of me and my brother ride
i don't rap for the plaques
my contract's signed just for scraps to get you wacked
nigga with a gun with a shank with a bat
take a slug through the lung get it right what you wack nigga
i'm born crazed deranged and more famous
than clappin down bangers meant for entertainment geah




young stat keep the gat on tuck
want war i don't give a fuck
shot 'til you kiss pucker up
it'll lift him up believe me you'll float
the result is your family heartbroke 
lookin like an artichoke vegetable hold stiff
nigga paralyzed from the neck down my goons stick niggaz
turn soldiers to stick figures hand on triggers
real life born killers we roll out like four wheelers
god shill us from back stabbers and goldiggers
tipsy off brown liquor watch me
obnoxious broads call me cocky
poppy long dick stat beat up the box like hockey
especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
from the benz to the range to the black jalopy

artist: eminem
album:  eminem presents: the re up
song:   no apologies
typed by: roach1984@hotmailcom

in my mind i'm a fighter my hearts a lighter
my soul is the fluid my flow sparks it right up
but arsenic writer often with arth er itis
carpel tunnel marshal with start shit itis
hard headed and hot headed
bull headed and pig headed
dick headed a prick a big headache i'm sick
quick with it for every lyric spit it
there are 6 critics who wait for me to slip with it
so quick this dynamite stick bury the wick
it's gonna ex plode any minute some lunatic
lit it and its not nelly do not tell me to stop yelling
when i stop selling i'll quit so stop dwelling
i am not failing you fuckers are not ready
cause i got jelly like beyonce's pot belly
this is destiny yes money
i'm off running so get off of me
i'm not slowing the softening

no apologies nah suckers i'm not sorry
you can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me
no apologies y'all feeling the force of me
no remorse for me like there was no recourse  for me
no apologies not even acknowledging you at all
till i get a call that god's coming
no apologies laugh fuckers its all funny
i can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
no apologies

my head hits the pillow a weeping willow
i can't sleep a pain so deep it bellows
but these cellos help just to keep me mellow
hands on my head touch knees to elbows
i'm hunched over emotion just flows over
these cold shoulders are both frozen
you don't know me
i keep saying it i can't stress it enough
so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
i choke mics like affixation
when i'm strangling my own throat masturbating
fuck yeah i'm a basket case
and i mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted
till my assassination till i'm slain cuz of some fags infatuation
44 mag's fascination a taste for disaster and if that's the case then

no apologies nah suckers i'm not sorry
you can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me
no apologies y'all feeling the force of me
no remorse for me like there was no recourse  for me
no apologies not even acknowledging you at all
till i get a call that god's coming
no apologies laugh fuckers it's all funny
i could spit in your face while you're standing across from me
no apologies

this song isn't for you it's for me
a true mc it's what he'll do
just to see if he still has it
and if his skills mastered
he's able to spill raps long after he's killed that's a
real mc got you feeling me
whether willing or unwillingly you still agree
as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
then expect a longer life expectancy
i'd be a savage beast if i ain't had this outlet to salvage me
inside i'd be exploding soaked in self loathing
and mourning so i'm warning you don't coax me
it's silly but really its sheep in wolves clothing
who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be
fooled the press blows up this whole thing
it's stupid they don't know cuz they don't see
that i'm wounded all they did was ballooned it
i'm sick of talking bout these tattoos cartoon did
that's why i tuned it out i'm sick of duking
they can suck my dick while i'm puking and you too you can

expect no sympathy from me
i'm an mc this is how i'm supposed to be
cold as a g my hearts frozen it don't even beat
so expect no apologies
expect no sympathy from me
i'm an mc this is how i'm supposed to be
cold as a g my hearts frozen it don't even beat
so expect no apologies o trice c'mon


yeah niggaz got me
i'ma get 'em it ain't over


you can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice 
and i'm poppin the clip 'bout to fix this issue 
you pray that i don't hit i ain't equipped to miss you 
you're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue 
or either have a bag on your hip to shit through 
you seen us on the ave ain't just to get you
but my penis is a mag when i lift it hits you 
cause i don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol


i solemnly swear on my daughter's tears
the nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends
 hope you inconspicuous my friend
cause once the word get back you in a world of sin 
bullets will hurdle at him for tryin to murder what's
been determined as the first solo african 
to go platinum where the accident happened at
but maggots i'm alive with vengeance to get back 
my momma blood pressure was affected from that
my lil' girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time
exact now and niggaz act wild 
but when the mac come out y'all niggaz ex' out 
and i don't wanna hear x y z
i'm x'in out your whole entity for tryin to kill me 
filthy motherfuckers i'll show you what real be 
when these h t b's light up your kidneys 
i'm so sincere you see in a hearse this year
it's not a verse it's a curse from birth and what's on your person over here
this is obie hearin clear niggaz beware
we're comin at you with firearms in air 
and your purpose so superfluous
how could i be merciful when murkin me's a mercenary's goal 
nigga i got paper i'll have ya ass urgently exposed 
no emergency's bringin back your souls
slugs shatter your bones for pat pattin me in the dome
learn this patter in we catch him at home he wrong
that's when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
another dirty motherfucker's gone 






"second round's on me" 
oh shit runnn 
hello
what up
hello yo i can't i can't hear you
let me call you back

i sense someone's tapping into my phones why do
i got this feeling in my bones i might die soon
the fbi might be trying to pull my file soon
i might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
i might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
right outside the window of my living room
and if they do you can say good night and by bye to them itunes
if i don't try to record as much before i do
the plan is to have as many in the can as i can
as i stand before you in this booth of walking dead man
blank stair dead pan look on my face as i gaze into space
as i wait to be scooped up in that van
as i mysteriously disappear into thin air
and they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
and i'll go down in the history
as the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech
tried to take the 5th amendment use it twist it and bend it
and ended up dying the villian not the hero
splendid stupendous way to end this i can feel the tremors tremendous
in remembrance of september 11th
flash back to september 7th when 2pac was murdered in vegas
he said it he predicted his own death let us never forget it
should we ever live to regret it
like that day john f kennedy was assassinated in broad day
by the greatest lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository
where the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the grassy knoll
but they don't know or do they
who's they for 'em to say touche'
we're all vulnerable and its spook ay
this is about as kook ay as i've ever felt now
count down to nuclear meltdown
7654321
you can run you can do what you want to
but you know you ain't gonna do nothing
when its time it's your time
you are the prime target
you have become public enemy #1

fucked in the game and act like dames
over fame just watch the change change
muh'fuckers so quick to blame
all the beef fly like planes make it sayin the same
look what ca$h money did to bg juvenile and wayne
the root of evil with much disdain
of course they go against the grain
to maintain tryin to obtain big thangs
jealousy and hunger make the tec go 
now you on the flo' blood leakin out your brain
mannn that's the way it is
that's how it be that's how we live
watch your back cause these kids
tote ammo and they'll split your wig

  2x w/ ad libs


  shady narcotics
 sh sh sh sh sh sh shady
nothing can stop and nothing can change
and you better just make new livin' arrangments
if you think you the top and king of the castle
you about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
all i hear is i'm the best at this and i'm best at that
but i don't hear my name no  brought up in rap
and i don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best i'm nowhere thought up as that
not even the same leage as jay z nas pac biggie or maybe
the name me somewhere down at the bottom right after az
or say he ripped that biggie verse or that jay z
yo his verses were crazy on that "renegade" beat
but i ain't never bought no whole cd of shady
and all i hear is pop tunes come on the radi o
and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
and they very well maybe
the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip hop legends which is amaze me
cause i thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big ba big big bay ba baby


so maybe the eighties made me crazy
i've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace slim shady
gave me the gate key paved the way
so lately my stakes get better each day
replay my relay race when i was chasin the afee at eighteen
eight years later his voice in beijing
no choice i chase cream so

 shaaaddyyywe're back


this is what i eat sleep and breath and feed my kids
would it fulfill all my family needs 
i treat the mic like the block
fuck with my rocks and squeeze
critics expecting me to underachieve
i just deal with the hate i recieve
by rolling back my sleeves
sure was a breeze i bring him right to his knees
and tell him "suck my dick"
i take a bow and leave
with a sack full of unmarked cheese
i find it hard to believe
who to pull or proceed
to be g's and claim they runnin shit

the same mouth got me the deal with dre and e
folk in the hood be askin where i be

chorus: royce da 5'9" eminem

 yo if it wasn't for your whip i'd have nothin to strip
	if it wasn't for a wrist i'd have nothin to slit
	if it wasn't for the shrooms i'd have nothin to chew
 yo
	i'm just fuckin with you cause i got nothin to do


i am bored
i came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
ate hors d'oeuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
let you inhale the glock smell while i'm rippin your wallet off 
and slippin a molotov in your cocktail 
burnin your contracts punch your a&r in the face *punch sound*
smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
i'm on some shook shit if it's missin i took it 
nurse look at this straightjacket it's crooked
i go to jail and murder you from a cell
put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail 
so how do you describe someone with a decapitated head 
when the rest of his body's still alive runnin


comin with five gunmen waitin to do a drive by
so when you see the black 500  hide from it
for every hundred mc's rhymin about birds
only about two thirds'd really set it without words
yo you ain't a thug i can make you bitch up
pick the fifth up cock spit you would swear it's rainin slugs 
i'm the hottest shit in the industry 
i got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
you lack class and respect get a direct backblast
the bad and evil mad rap i cover the bad half
you know how a thug in this shit'll end up
spit a round lift your chin up you get hit ten down and ten up 
i take it if you run your mouth then you wanna get sent up
heat it up you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
now we rivals cause of a small name or title
you stepped got devoured and left with a flower and bible

chorus: 2x


*yawns*  forget a chorus    my metaphors are so complicated 
it takes six minutes to get applause 
and by the time you all catch on i'ma end your career 
and walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on
i'll throw you off of ten floors  *ahhhhhhh*
pull a fuckin headache outta my head and put it in yours 
i'm indoors waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in stores
this bitch wanted to blow me i said "it oughta happen
you swallow cum bitch"   "no but i brought a napkin"
gettin skullie while i'm autographin
got my daughter laughin cause i sent her mother whitewater raftin
i'm not a fact i'ma proven fear
mr rogers blocked up my u haul screamin 
"wait wait wait you ain't movin here"
lorena bobbitt c'mere want a souveneir
i've been high as fuck since i was a juvi neer
juvenile  same difference    i need some 'caine 
cause i ain't sniffed since i woke up the seven slain infants
 brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
i won't stay the same cause i traded brains with a chimpanz'


walkin in swamp water with an m 16 out for the blood
shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
to break braces you say grace and make faces
i'll display hate and break you in eight places 
take paces turn around draw in a standoff
precise aim icin my fame blowin your hand off
dancin with the devil leadin   i won't die i'm never leavin 
i pledge allegiance to forever breathin
street niggaz with nuts what  my meat's bigger 
fake ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
with a deathwish thinkin i'm the nigga to mess with
let the tech lift direct chest hit melt your necklace
for instance you just a henchmen on tough soil 
a follower never had heart he just loyal
thugs is glass doors i see through em put the heat to em
be careful you might get what you ask for

chorus 2x

	the bad the evil
	the bad the evil
uh oh yeah

you know we put money on it when it's real
they call me mr fifty a head i'm sendin ten niggaz to kill ya at ten until
every man got an expiration date and a price
all my revolvers got the spinnin wheel
i make the lord you pray to appear tonight like vanna white
them racketeerin charges startin to look like a tennis deal
i call the garden in my back yard garden of weeden
lookin like some spinach spiel   but still i'm dealin raw
from sellin to buyin weed actually i'm stealin all
i'm the last of a dyin breed that i'm out here killin off
four of my closest friends don't know their papas
so i pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin off
get money




hold up shhh i should've been born deaf mute
talkin gets you stripped naked
shootin at your feet dancin 'til chip and dale's at your rescue
if there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you
look time is money i'm on est
keep playin light up your block like christmas e v e
i'm the new edition of poison bbd
for that bread my niggaz'll stamp you ebt
i let a hot line sting 'em you in the cop's line singin
ever since you left the city now they hotline's blingin
hmm seen a paddy wagon cruisin and i'm deducin
that they are only movin cause all the rumors that you in
if i had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losin
is because of the illusion you are not in collusion
with the boys that's wearin blue and it's causin all this confusion
and they wouldn't even know but y'all tellin what niggaz doin




i'm goin on an ak a thon
throw a bible at some shallow waters right before i go and pray upon
double parked custom license plates says i can pay a fine
i ain't in the zone i'm in the motherfuckin lay up line
speakin of lay ups we do homi's based on how we doin
last lay up line i was in was a body viewin
i'm preoccupied with the earth's ills
good herbals first meal was milk i milk these niggaz for my first mil'
full circle off of just talkin i could tell types
but i'll still give that bitch my whip test
if she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe
playin that dirty hand i was dealt don't complain to me nigga tell christ
i'm standin over coffins with hammers and screws with a sickness
man a cure/manicure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right
only hand me down i had was inherited head lice

e'ry day one for the body of martin luther king i'm dead nice
rest call me malcolm they want me dead because i'm dead right
ask me to spell die i'ma accidentally spell dice
i can shelve a label with my shelf life
i'm a rider but still i steal bikes

niggas expect me to go pop oh stop

for me to come up with shit and just say: "ayyyyyye"
im at a loss for words cause yall already said it all
i think im runnin out of cliches im gettin writers block 


when i stand up in this booth niggas notice it
sittin on the same boat that noah built
floatin on the same water moses split
poetry in motion but we sittin on your grave site overkill
arent you tired why are you so loud quiet
real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin a new hybrid
you dudes is too excited
you a dude thatd try to sue a dude thats suicidal
you will just be another victim
i am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie im a little twisted
i roll like the end credits in movies yall just got scripted
got yall niggas bitches bobbin to this one when she witcha
when she wit me she bobbin not vibin
tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
im a serpent with a purpose havin problems
not a problem ive encountered
i have found elephants lions clowns
will jump through hoops like they workin for the circus
at the fire round the circles right in front of them fire rounds
pun intended gun extended what are you marks askin
cars aston started as a hard top and i saw past it
since i decided to start class diss
all black all glass panoramic roof been gettin marked absent

if he was white
what if he was white
what if he was white
what   if   he   was   white
what if he was white
what if he was
white white white white white white white white white white


yo yo
what if i was white skin the same color as cocaine
blond hair blue eyes the whole shibang
i know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
pull me over for nothing constantly jockin me 

the yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
i wouldn't need collateral to buy property
if i was white wouldn't matter if i was rich or poor
security wouldn't follow me around the store
like i'd steal something 
because i'm black i rob and automatically assume i ain't got no job
on my own land i feel like an immigrant
if i was white i wouldn't of thought oj was innocent 

chorus: eminem

it would be a different world for me
if i was white  what shade would i be 
would i be redneck or skinhead preppy or high class
you probably live in a trailerpark and be white trash
in any case that be the ill shit right 
but there's a good and bad side of being white
you can't say the n word without startin a fight 
couldn't dance to a beat i'd have two left feet
even if i was white plaque still have a ghetto shit 
is it a myth or do i really have a little dick 
if i was white i would probably listen to hard rock
and cover my ears when ever i heard hip hop 


if he was white
what if he was white

what if he was white white  white white he was white
what if he was white
what if he was

what if he was white 
what if he was
white white white white white white white white white white 



yo yo yo if i was white
i probably wouldn't even think the same
i'd watch tennis and golf and bet on hockey games 
wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
if i was white
i couldn't live around my way
and there probably would of never even been an onyx shit
i be serice sippin vodka and tonix
smokin on a marlboro instead of a newport
id live in long island instead of new york
if i was white i probably couldn't dunk
cuz everybody knows white man can't jump 
and probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
cuz all of the dreads would think i'm a cop


if he was white
what if he was white
what if he was white
what   if   he   was   white 
what if he was white
what if he was
white white white white white white white white white white

what if you were white

mayhem sickness murder horror
these are the kind of words that describe my aura
g rap ras kass kurupt redman
i am cut from that cloth write a rhyme about me you a dead man
cool j "i'm bad" video
learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
while they smoked and drink symphony doc
inspired me to write what would eventually put me on airplanes like bob
canibus wu tang you know our history but hats off
when we rap as jack frost we outline the track chalk
thank god for the one two cadence
thank god for the lunchroom tables
i'm tryin to be the sickest nigga dead or alive
and if i happen to fall short it's been one hell of a ride
"chronic" 1 and 2
lookin up at the sky at the sun up until the day the sun is you
you're listenin to hip hop
you in jay house wayne house nas house em house 


so welcome to our house
where no one comes back out
you might find comfort
in here in here in here


when i was a lil' boy i wanted to be a rapper
wanted to be on the radio and snappin pictures after
and so i grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
it started off wack but in the words of a 10 year old my shit was gettin phatter
i hit the studio at 16 stupid ill
not knowin how the booth would feel what's a dats and 2 inch reels
how you ad lib what's a punch i ain't a boxer
but i sure enough learned the ropes look d and mike y'all made a monster
now every day's a game of contra i got 99 men
an infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
this is my dream don't fuck with it i'm tellin you
cause anyone can get dusted long as production is available
i'm disgusted as a fan look how niggaz soundin damn
weak head y'all suck bad fuck swag and your kicks from south japan
i'm finna be the best in this profession
i've been invested all my life so wipe your feet before you step in 



  
i wanna be the best who ever did it
don't know if that goal is feasible or it isn't
but if it is then god if you're listenin
please give me the strength to crush all competition
you can't blame me for dreamin i'm a dreamer
and if i'm comin off brash please forgive me
but that's all i want 
that's all i want 


yo in my house the lights out no utilities in this facility
feelin my life's 'bout to wipe out these feelings i'm feelin be killin me
i pull a mic out can't strike out cause if winnin is really my enemy
i'll pull a 9 out blow my mind out is the end of me really serenity
man in my house it's rap or die get a piece of that apple pie
life is a pharcyde song and that bitch just passes by
so i got lyrically complex that way i could fly jets
get my moms out the projects with these concepts competition can't digest
and then i stress cause the road is rough i start feelin like shit's sour
the electricity in my willpower can still power the twin towers
for ten hours so send cowards
the message from crooked i royce da 5 joe budden em yaowa


in our house we spittin like six hours the way i feel now i can spit for six hours
straight only way to be great is to dig down if you can hear this sound in 
 side my head sounds like a fuckin drive by that's what the inside of my mind's like
lookin back on my career even hindsight's tunnel vision 5 mics
never wanted that so bad feel like i could go mad nomad with a notepad
go taz spaz on these hoe bags that bother me but i never wanna show that
just don't act like it ever does even though you know that there will never come
a day someone blows past you who never was someone who's as dope as you ever was
and you hope that's true cause the competitor in you couldn't let somebody be better than you
and you know that so you don't ever hold back what you gonna go back to workin a regular job
fuck that i'ma go hard grab on my gonads   tell 'em fuck theyself
they call me a wigger/'weger like renee zell' but i raised hell like a stay at home dad
rap is the only thing that i was ever really bad to the bone at
guess i'm similar to gang green when i'm angry then i'm hulk smash
so much passion but no compassion if eyes are the window to the soul
then it's broken glass and there's no trespassin aight now here we go
dre stamped me now i'm stampin yelawolf be ready for the most competitive
clique in the world it's like clash of the titans i release the cracker it's time to set it again
and when it's said and it's all done none shall ever fuck with the squadron

brought to you by the wooorrrlld famous wake up show


bobby steels staple' tails mc's get your lips stapled
project killa hill is stamped on the map like the compass
sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you 
you can't escape seventy thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box
walk wit alarm clocks cars drivin slow down the block
one stopped parks pops his trunk
snare pops loud as glock shots
bass like an m 80 in ya face cops stop give us citation
we pause for radio station identification
wake up wake up wake up 


when i woke up i grabbed the mic and never choked up
busted a verse and all the g's in cali loc'ed up when i was summoned
styles were mixed like the drummonds
killer clown is comin lookin around your town is crumblin
this big tech from the midwest leavin mc's litless
on the wake up show make up no stories about my shake up flow
put me off in a cypher potna you can't *fuck* wit the snyper
your flow's premature clean your dirty diaper
mic heister psycho alpha schizo
hypno chryo gat flow guru and ain't nobody tighter
sway & tech heard me flow and it's sealed
now i got swedish women yellin "tech n9ne svelte"


this place is my house i might as well erase my face wit white out
cuz y'all can't see me like mase's eyebrows 
climbed out of a nice house
through the front window and heard this guy shout
"hey that's my couch "
pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
while i'm rippin this shit put a clip in it spit five rounds
and murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle
nose first wit the top off landin up side down
you're tied down and duct taped fuck rape
i'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
and sway & tech two disk jockeys
breakin so many friggin needles i wonder if they inject


lo and behold better than platinum and gold
yes god bless success never forsake your soul
xzibit take control lock loaded and ready to roll
play the upper hand a man that's never gon' fold
cuz your tape sucks find a new hobby that you can take up
or listen to my niggas tech & sway so you can wake up
the x man catch me doin drills in the danger room
big game huntin from high noon till the full moon


wit synonyms i get an adrenaline rush
from minimum thrusts bust multiple assaults in small interims
as horrid as boris korloff was
when i cut ya neck leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
hauled off sawed off shotgun blast
he asked why did he have to die like cast metal
o huh c now like omar credle
we pone pedal at a high resolution 
on the wake up show wit sway tech and dj revolution

*dj revolution scratches*


i sway the tec wit the tech and sway
step away wet and spray rep the day
who over debt to pay get swept away
across the whole board like checker play
when i blaze your whole sect' arrays
wake up show for those who slept away
niggas that met the trey hit the deck and pray
dj revolution spinnin like lead from out the head decay
tearin your neck away flood up the street wit blood redecorate
until the head of jake investigate

tech  can give it to you but whatcha gon' do
rev can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it
i can give it to you wha wha wha what what

fuckin up entire record companies like harrell did to motown
vominous talk poison pen hominous walk
which flow will i destroy you wit this time the most commonest thought
the drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
for instance there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me
clone me like sheep i clean house like tony randall
my style foul/file for sexual harrassment like tisha campbell
you wack like will smith your rhyme style is pansy
i fuckin murder your young style like jon benet ramsey
now who the master to beg your demo get passed on the reg'
you shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
i'm wake up show reppin wit sway & tech

you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
"he'll never make it his wrist is slit too bad" 
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad

what a wonderful day; i should go outside and play
ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
hi renee  i was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway  and drive away 
are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids
blood drippin from it rippin your stomach like a paper mache
you talk a lotta shit but you was never ill though
i'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh 
jumped up choked a giraffe snapped his neck and broke it in half
wagin wars went on stage and sprayed cage with agent orange
and wiped my ass with his page in source 
the demon is here steamin this year
i rip  voicebox out scream in his ear 
it's not a gimmick bitch it's an image i live it
give a fuck  i don't know what a fuck is to give it
"yeah i don't think this guy is well"  i'm high as hell
i'll beat you with a live cat when i'm swinging him by his tail


i'll fuckin i'll fuckin
lay your nuts on the dresser
just your nutsack by itself
and bang them shits with a spiked bat
cut your neck off and sew your head right back
and leave you like that

you just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than chris topher
reeves i was teething with strep throat 
while your mother was breastfeeding
and gave her the flesh eating disease
i'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through south central la bleedin in jeans
  wakin up the next day in breathin machines
flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked and if you do live
you'll be too scared to tell it like a biggie and 'pac joke

so if i hurt your self esteem and you get dissed too bad
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
and when i rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
"i can't listen to that song that shit's too sad"
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad
"he'll never make it his wrist is slit too bad"
you know i just be sayin that to get you mad

i know that makes you real mad don't it

typed by: atomant72@aolcom

met a retarted kid named greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg
go to bed with a keg wake up with a forty
mix it with alka seltzer and formula 44 d
forget an acid tab i'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
no more said case closed end of discussion
we blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
cross the bombest
we blowing up your house
killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
i'm as good at keeping a promise as nastradamus
cause i ain't making no more threats
i'm doing drive bys in tinted corvettes
on vietnam war vets
i am more or less sick in the head
maybe more 
because i smoked crack  today yesterday
and the day before sabateur
walk the block with a labrador
strapped with more straps than el salvador
foul style galore
verbal cow manure
coming together like an eyebrow on al b sure
it's like that 
alright bust it 


it's only fair to warn i was born with a set of horns
and metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four
and smash into your honda accord with a four door ford
but i'm more toward droppin' an acapella
to chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
got chu' locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'
developin' anorexia while i'm standin' next to ya
eatin' a four course meal watchin' you starve to death
put a iv in ya vein feedin' ya liquid darvaset
pumpin' you full of drugs
pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs
who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving
with they asses ripped out of they pants
and given a less than twenty percent chance of livin'
havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient
storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement
doctor kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy
on you while you scream "i'm still alive"
drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp
i'm pullin' ya adam's apple out through ya mouth
better call the fire department i've hired an arsonist
to set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment


peace to thirstin howl al and wordsworth
my mother smoked crack i had a premature birth
i'm just a nerd cursed wit badly disturbed nerves
who wanna be the one to step up and get served first
ninety nine percent of aliens prefer earth
so i'm here to rule the planet startin wit your turf
i hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
wit smeard letters runnin together in blurred spurts
i hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
been a bad boy since diapers and gerber's
my first words were "bleep bleep" and "curse curse"
never had ish and i still don't deserve dirt
my breath still stinks and i'm on my third certs
yankin out my stitches hollering "nurse nurse"
"you said this shot would numb it trick it just hurts worse"
grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
but gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
and it's like that and it's like that


got no apathy

evidence i won't get caught shot on the balcony
between you and i i'll tell you here's the diff
gun to your head you're dead pointblank i shapeshift
that's right to dear/deer anelope or owl
in life use your potential or steve howe
i'm about to call it quits yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
the man'll make you move yo so make your move a backout
you say i use my name too much as a clutch
try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch
flipped it backwards evidence attack nerds off the head
steadfast right or left don't matter see you comin 
deaf/def like leppards pop the piece  i be the sheppard
causin the herd the name is ev absurd
verbs get flipped it's like this yo acronyms and all that
methaphor imagery you claimin metaphors and spittin similies
not havin it the name is evidence
like pos k gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it
skills prevail you possess take no offense
but don't profess lies within your mind tempt and stress

smothered in hot mustard so when i feed it to you it's easy to eat it
you need to be immediately treated
while you breathin' you'll be leavin'
the receiving room this evening with jesus
you hate on us we'll be waitin' on eight corners
swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
i'll hop in the jeep slam on the gas and charge you
and bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you
mess around and get choked and found in a moat
floatin' around drowned face down in a boat
i'll pile five dudes in a pen
and we'll pull up to the seven mile drive thru
at mcdonald's and pile drive you
i got the power to snatch a driver out his eddie bauer
when it rides by me at ninety miler per hour
this place is my house i might as well erase my face with white out

i'm about to loose my wife i can't afford a divorce




fucking with your pussy is a handful

plus i remember back when you was young
i could see 100 niggaz through your gap
and all of them was probably hitting that thats embarrassing

fucking newly weds didn't mean to do it but you did


devil is she she never to be 
credit to free its better that she 
even her apple

cause he knowin that tecca nina's a dirty chopper
he's handle holmes here's a handful
how in the hell he hoverin havin hella go ham though
i said to seven "richie havens'll be the man"
so we put it together thinkin eminem was a gamble

so now the people finally get three of the best locked
never be another "choppers" comin so let's rock
nigga you're on
people got to wonderin if it's a for sure song
yes i got another killer makin a tour strong
if you thinkin of battlin you're gone


nobody can catch up meetin speedy gonzalez the beat is the problem
and if ya got your feet in your mouth you gon' have to beat it up out of him
it's a lot of 'em and i mean a lot of 'em
and me and nina used to follow 'em i've got to audibly body 'em
this is it man the hitman the ip man karate 'em
and the fans will lift hands we'll be dancin out of 'em
and in kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
if i ain't makin sense
then you better sample the amp into la cabeza
it ain't ever been a gift for me to heat 'em i beat 'em i burn 'em
 they never heard of us but look at 'em turnin up
i slap the shirt off a super simpleton makin 'em be impotent
if and when i be flippin niggaz be feminine
i said the purpose to pimp a pen
and reverse the conditions i'm livin in and do bigger numbers than eminem
gotta be fast or i'll smash on a nigga
with half the cash i'm a little sicker quicker than you figure

wait before i wreck this beat let me just check to see
if stephanie mills left any extra refills
of ecstacy pills next to me in the seats spilled
or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink 
i'm in the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin i dabble in vic's
but i might just swallow my fuckin ritalin tablet after tonight
i'm grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet cause that's what it's like
and attackin it like a dracula bite jetpack in a backpack when i write
all this anger pent up inside i went up inside a bennigans diner
with a cigarette lighter figured i'd try to set a big enough fire
that'll trigger the sprinkler system and i'd escape but the getaway driver
screwed up my limo collided
with the center divider i went through the window and ended
up bein pinned to the side of a semi fended
beside a friend of the guy's wife brenda
the flight attendant from idaho that took an antenna in the vagina
cause when i pick up a pen i'm venomous and i'm as slick as dennis the menace
like an evil dental hygienist and sinister
you've been yellin dementedness i invented this
i'm the genesis eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
fuckin smart alec degenerate i got ellen degeneres
tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy envious
of female independence hell with a clitoris hit or miss
you will never consider this a bitter disappointment i'll never fail to deliver this
whatever the weather in this'll be
just like a certificate of authenticity   but i'm thinkin about
just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way to make 'em picket i pick a day
to be a prick then i'm pickin the wickedest shit to say
spit it back on a level incredible head full of red bull unforgettable
better believe these beats are edible and i consider loose leaf a vegetable
and i stalk my prey
you think you got away uh uh not today
murder you on a song and then i'll just say
i was with dr dre and robert blake eatin lobster steak
and coffee cake at a restaurant with drake
and tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
i'm a lot to take
like kanye walkin up on the stage for beyoncé like it's my job to say
that you're not a real artist but it's my obliga 
 tion honest abe is on his way you will not escape
ammunition replenished the punisher with his gun insured
hundred words and a clip other words motherfuckers better run
if you're not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner
no wonder no one don't wanna go and jump in front of
a fuckin runaway locomotive or get thrown up under it
just tryna fuck with the




i'm the fury the final fight
i flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin fright
i flick it on fire finish him when the flow in flight
feminine fakers fall i'm floggin a foe with a fife
never forget it i severed the head of a critic
i sped up and did it you trippin to be a dead epidemic
or wet up a clinic and make a bloody redder percentage
of an addict who's havin to get the lead of a cynic
i was never the devil i put up a fight up in the industry
peddle the metal we givin the light a lot of energy
we reppin beat checkin he that be koba
if he's the evil enemy it'll be over
wanna get down in front of your town
you ever makin fun of the clown i'm gunnin you down
we doin it under the ground a wonderful sound
if anybody come at the hound no one'll be found 
would never be choppin without slick rick
i got it from the record lick the balls and this dick
if you never listen to me you musical misfit
nah cause every time i be droppin i get bit

if you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
cause me and my nigga twista ruler and this it~




me and marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
and talk shit about us but that shit is foul
when i'm tryin to feed my son and drop multi platinum albums
make my mother proud that her son made it out

they say shit but fuck them shady one of the greatest
like biggie and 'pac was we saw the throne was empty
and decided to chase it me him and 50 racin

for the day that they got them affadavits wavin
in my face lookin for answers rap senssation
eminem battles to ward off accusations

too much time me no kiss ass and if that's the case

through your radio waves it plays and plays
till it stays stuch in your head for days and days

reaching for a t shirt to wear that i would carapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this

kids are flying through the air looking like they krumping
the way they tumbling i gotta do something
but as soon as i hit the car wash to get the tar off
they just right back at it tommorrow
they're like "dad this is in so you're with the trends"
"this is for the pimps listening to mens nail polish on the rims"
and now it's custom chrome but i gotta go do a show
so go on with ya bad self just have it back to normal when i touch down




from my arrival un til my departure
gurantee i put this d i c k in somebody's daughter
ay i still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
flew to paris from haiti did some shit that i thought of
it's erotic that the shit that we popping makes us psychotic
threaten corporate america that's why they running from me
how could they be so ignorant look what hip hop done brung us
it's allowed us to run a business legitimated our moneys
got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
i made it all the way here ain't no way you taking it from me
so excuse me oprah honey i'm sorry really i promise
but niggas bitches and hoes do exist i'm just being honest
for that am i being punished why is you so astonished
now i ain't got a degree just intelligence in abundance
so you ain't gotta like me i know billions of folks who love me
you can tell how they yelling and screaming and waiting for me when i touch down


if i'm elected for ten terms
i'm renewing the staff after the inagural
and hiring all girls as interns
if i don't like you i'll snatch you outta your mic booth
while you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
i'll take you straight to the pavement
uppercut you and scrape your face wit a bracelet
like a razor that shaved it
three drinks and i'm ready to flash
runnin on stage in a g string wit a bee sting on my ass 
it's probably all cuz i ain't awkward at all
i just like to walk through the mall stop and talk to the wall
and have a relapse after i just fought through withdrawl

the bad and evil movement is comin
plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
i write a rhyme a day
so it's no wonder how come your whole album 
is soundin like a bunch of shit that i would say
whether it's one verse or one letter
i'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
it's slim shady and tony touch it's only us
the rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit monie love

doin a box of doctrine on stompin oxygen
  wit fork to your optic lens
hittin wit a sudden force
leave your boy layin in the same puddle of blood as yours
when i flood his porch
smuugle a gun in court and shoot the judge
easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
a double deuce wit slugs i'm proof on drugs
we'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
how you on medicine cabinet pills
grabbin the steel leapin over buildings that haven't been built

it ain't too much mo' we can say
to try to get these different individuals
or motherfuckers as i like to call 'em
to just shut the fuck up
let's go


you witnessed the ass whoopin bones got broke
when the 50 cal blast couldn't last through the smoke
as you choke pay attention bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
you excited cause none of the bullets hit you they missed you
and we ain't trippin wasn't after you
but you pissed just like a bitch when niggaz laughed at you
now you agitated a little bit actin just like a little bitch
i figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
sayin "trick that trick this"
when the balls that you had left when i popped him
you shoulda died with him body and soul coulda burned
i'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
fuck time and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
i ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme and i ain't lyin
i'm man enough to say it and mean it niggaz can be gone
i'ma do another verse but it ain't much more i can speak on


there's nothin more these words can say 
this hard headed motherfucker just won't let it lay 
so say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave 
so stand clear bitches better get the fuck out my way 


let me show you how i started as a starvin artist
this is proof with the truth regardless of all this 
as my ceo and best friend of the essence
of why nobody in detroit wan' test him

the rest of these niggaz is comical i'ma go abdominal
split like a domino rhymin pro
shine without a diamond go geronimo to any man with balls
murder you bitches still screamin "fuck the law"




since talkin about it is considered as conversation
then i'm more than happy to be the sponsor of demonstrations
from beatin these cases to bustin in faces and bustin these k's
niggaz gon' act like they don't wanna act right
fuck that had to begin settin the trend
of organizin a mob and bringin it to an end
the levels of toleration'll cease for givin passes
that's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
entertainers they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
an up and comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
fuck it i'ma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
if this motherfucker even blinks put a clip into him
don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
the reason most of these niggaz is hatin is cause they greedy
uncovered another man's shit now that's a real bitch
now the next motherfucker gon' die that's it~

but it's time you met the real me
filthy but wasn't always will be
your pill re fill and i'll still be
your addiction you can touch a prescription but don't fill/feel me
i let you see my dark side
but like a mic check you got one two/too
so when the sparks fly
we hit the flight deck and got sprung pew
like an ejector seat from an f 15
but tonight we don't need those pills just the effects of each
other but we gon' film
cause i will want your ex to see
 that


i only call you when it's half past five
the only time that i'll be by your side
i only love it when you touch me not feel me
when i'm fucked up that's the real me
when i'm fucked up that's the real me yeah

you said he drove you to my arms
but don't ya  remember when i told ya

and i hope ya  feel like dirt when i hold ya 
cause is it really over
but you just want a little company
and you just really want a thrill seek
said you left him for good this time
bullshit what your friends do spill beans
or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
but these hills see from that pov
we can touch but the only way you'll film me
is with a camera feel me
you're nothin but a barfly
you got your sights set on the one who you run to
but i'm a far cry
from what you might get if we come true
so keep textin me
but at night if you seek those thrills what i expect to be
cause if you cheat on him just means i will be the next to be
your ex so no complexities
just sex and don't lecture me
just accept that




hills have eyes the hills have eyyyyyyyes
who are youuuuu to judge who are youuuuu to juuuudge

rush me cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
i'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by moby
if i let some bitch in the can like 'bis cop over me
to do war and try to bring my crew back down
i'll never stoop to that level to do that now
i got a new cat this time i'm pullin two gats out
with bullets i finally got somethin to shoot at now


let's see who got they city on lock
let's see who got the better aim with the glock
let's see who come out on top
let's see who really want they name in the streets
let's see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
now was i blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
i follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
and i'll be damned if i let billy dance dupri
or anybody swing an axe at my family tree so now


i love it when you niggaz be talkin sayin my name
seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
two zero zero three and shit it ain't the same
better have a strap my nigga simple and plain
put your nuts on the table my nigga let's play the game
hurt you so long you'll be a ddicted to pain
i don't wanna hear what you meant do not explain
right before you lay in your coffin hoe say my name


why do you hate me  i came from nothin
blood sweat and tears you did not create me
how can you doubt me  you don't know shit about me
there'd be no west coast without me
cut with the bullshit  i struggle for survival
and now you tryin to act like my rival
watch what you say partner it's a small earth
don't play games with your life nigga it's not worth
all the pain  all the agony 
all the horror  all the tragedy 
put your hands up people it's time to fight now
i beat holes in your chest remain hostile
threaten my life  one day you'll understand
they say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
so who the fuck  you think you talkin to
live and direct in the flesh i'm right in front of you




i never really smashed on jermaine's ass dre smashed him
nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
i never really brought it to his ass i tapped him
i coulda been like treach boom bapped and slapped him
purple for mimickin him with two rappin urkels
i coulda snapped took it past rap and hurt you
but i didn't i kept it on wax and served you
i "square dance" cause i'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns stready tryin to call me out
it's like i'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
you'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
you don't want it with rap this is what i'm all about   c'mon
 no gangsta you ain't either
 but i know that i spit "ether"
 i shit across your belly
 show you i'm not r kelly
x pass me the weed i'ma put my ashes out on his ass
for the last time man 




for the last time man i'm through pssh man i need a lighter man
 right here
 yeahhh whassup slim
 what's crackin
 hit this shit
 ssshhit i almost hit this motherfucker today
 psh is that right
 what is it with motherfuckers thinkin that
  because we're in the spotlight or whatever that
 they can do or say whatever they want to us
 and that we won't retaliate
 protect my motherfuckin self by any
 means necessary
 right


cause you don't know me i don't know you
so don't approach me i won't approach you
and don't insult me i won't insult you
cause you don't know what i will or i won't do


make no mistake i'm the golden state heavyweight
bein underrated gave me time to create it
can you relate  i renovate straight out the gate
carried my weight but seem to receive nothin but hate
millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
kidnapped locked in a trunk get shot in the face
no hoes no clothes no one showin up for my shows
you know how it goes; i might as well kick it at home
but my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me 
packed up moved out started a new family
so all this strugglin for what so i can blow up
marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up
fuck that this the fuckin thanks i get
for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
yo i feel like my whole life is upside down 
cause you seein more support than i'm seein my child
it's like


 everyday i wake up another drama
it's a wonder i'm alive survivin this karma
if i can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
i might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
without these cameras in our faces like animals
for your channel 2 action news to follow our ambulence up the avenue
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
and you wonder why i carry every gun under the sun
whether it's unloaded full or an un registered one
no bullet you're so full of shit
this clip is so full it'll spit if i don't pull it
and don't give me no bullshit i'm not in the mood
i just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
over kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
don't tell me bout the show business shit
i know what this is bitch




this ain't business this is personal bitch
you don't know xzibit from shit new school class dismissed
i had a very fucked up day i'm needin this fit
shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
yo em it's time to get serious with it 
time for everybody to feel it similar to the egg in the skillet
this is your brain on drugs xzibit brain on thugs
ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
ain't no love lost my niggaz relax yo'self
i'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
to my niggaz who never seen it i mean it when i holla
at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
changin your channel you played like a fuckin piano
ridin slow through cali like i'm ridin a camel
millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
i feel like tony soprano who do i trust now
just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as i touch down
spit lines to split spines just to get mine
big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
sniff lines of coke that's the only shit that make you dope
bitch ass nigga that's droppin the soap
get choked out and beat put your head in a vise grip
and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit


so do i gotta buy a whole block to myself
a front door with twelve locks
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
and everytime somebody makes a threat run and tell cops
fuck that i protect myself with these twelve shots
and one in the chamber gun in the waist
and one in the ankle waitin for someone to come to my place
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face
and it's a disgrace hailey can't play with her toys
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
screamin some shit leanin out your windows beepin n shit
or pullin up in my drive like i won't leap in your whip
and so these kids tell their friends and relatives where i live
so my address ends up on the internet again
so then i do an interview with spin tellin them
that if someone comes to my crib i'ma shove a gun in their ribs
and reporters blow it out of proportion
"oh now he's pullin guns on his fans
 just for tryin to stand on his porch"
and i'm the bad guy cause i don't answer my door like "hey hi
you guys wants some autographs  okay form a straight line"
sometimes i feel like loadin this rifle
and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
it's not that i don't like you
 it's just that i'm not behind the mic
i'm a person who's just like you
ain't never been much of the church type
but i believe in the last dayyyyys
i walk through hell almost every night
but i believe it's a pathwayyyyy
say boy what you doin with your life
with those tattoos on your faaaaace
say boy you know that you'll pay the price
well i guess i'll see when i head that wayyyyy


to the father son and holy spirit i hold you nearest
my best friend best friend
let the trumpets blow with your appearance i can almost hear it
my best friend best friend
when you wish me hell upon my soul and spirit behold these lyrics
i got a best friend best friend
yeah i got a best friend best friend
yeah


i don't know much about holy bibles
but i grew up in the bible belt
i put my love for a woman on idle
because i got beat with my momma's belt
but i learned from my mistakes
try hard to respect people for what they believin in
but if you spit on my fuckin grave
and wish me hell then i wish you well i'ma send you straight up to my best friend



  
god please would you arm me with the armor to calm me when there's drama
like gandhi coulda gone the other way many times coulda turned dalai with the lama
but i squashed my beefs and things seem to be lookin decent recently but don't jinx it
it's like clint eastwood lookin for peace though maybe not fin' to enter the priesthood
but at least should make an attempt to show some remorse and then be some sort of a repenter
for the people i've been a menace to not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
into the mind of a thick skin but a short temper this patience of mine is thinner
than twine is when i get attacked so i might say somethin back that might offend ya
so if you don't like when i rap of what i have to say on the mic then ya
might wanna act just like quarterbacks and take a fuckin hike when i snap cause i'm a sinner
and uh  bust balls and intestines and ain't never been yes men
they gon' tell me when i'm fuckin up the minute i'm ever givin it less than
i'm about to vomit and i can feel it comin cause failure's somethin i can barely stomach
and i only listen to my guts so unless you're my fuckin belly button don't tell me nothin
you ain't my  who you think i'm talkin 'bout
lifts me up when i'm down and out still look to him without a doubt
still got a  shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
shoulda never been allowed i'm out now that i got a higher power now
with a blackout power outage oww like powerless but they crowd around
they tend to flock like shepherds to black sheep but i'll be the worst thing
that these motherfuckers ever heard when i'm counted out you be doa then announced
they pronounce you dead when they sound it out so prepare for arrival your arch enemy surrounds you now
he's all around you  not even a doctor's at the hospital he coulda shiggy shocked
you back to life just im piggy possible to revive you that's word to the diggy doc
stiggy stoppin is not an option somethin i'm not gonna do
i'm the iggy pop of hip hop when i walk in the booth dawg i'm the truth
like biggie rockin with 2pac in a suit talkin to proof droppin a deuce
fill up a syllable clip like a refillable strip cock and i shoot
 who you think's my glock that i use
that i pull from to get my strength up against these haters
and they be waitin at the gate when you get sprayed up sendin you hoes straight up
to deal with my 


mmmmmmmmmmm
in this world
ohhhhhhhhhhhh

  
yeah aight marshall
uhh 
uhh who am i



it's gettin hard to be me
everywhere i go somebody's lookin at me
and if i ever need somethin i'ma get it for myself
cause i'm the only person thinkin 'bout me 
it's gettin hard to be me
everywhere i go somebody's lookin at me
and if you gon' compare me at all best compare me to myself
cause i'm the only person fuckin with me 


in this world of sticks hicks and chicks with aqua net spray
sh sh shhhh shut up motherfucker don't disrespect these country ways
yeah alabama if y'ain't know
i ain't hidin a damn thing i just like to lean low
yeah i'm the theme show stereotypical beanpole
slim tall tatted let me add that i got a green glow
from all the mountain dew that i consume
from a mason jar in a racin car chase it with a tall ice brew
let me not leave you confused what i represent culturally
trash bag full of freon i'm huffin puffin on potpourri
that gummo's squeaky swingin gate in front of that trap house
trailer park is sewed up and billy done pulled that 'llac out 




wonder what i got inside this chevrolet trunk i'm hidin
about ten bodies on a fishin line with baby clothes on consignment
came to the game so broke that i still find $1 bills and get a thrill
that's the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
side of a single wide got icicles still too cold
got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill meatloaf
daddy's in jail again for shufflin pills we know
man i've only come to give you a peep show 
i run across the south like a wild stream smiling
i've seen more colorful mushrooms than a child's dream
on an island desolate left behind cause my state's a state of crime
god said 1979 go change the minds 




yelawolf hi my name is
president o bama i'm so shameless

put down about prices found on a sack of that white

rather die in the hands of the judge than former friends

someone has got somethin to say

ohhhh oh ohhhh oh
someone's got a problem i wanna know
keep my name out your motherfuckin mouuuuuth
somebody talk to me


walkin like i fuckin talk it play it how i say it
and i swear sometimes hear voices talkin to me in my head
some nights i slept amongst the livin dead to get this bread
it's two ways out this shit a casket or the fuckin feds
i rap cause one day i pray this might be my escape
every day i seal up these baggies seems like i'm sealin my fate
my momma birthed a young gangsta jumped off the porch out the gate
but i can't let my momma bury me that's some shit she can't take
most niggaz hate when you come up and you doin somethin constructive
police to the politician my whole city corrupted
wanna convict me for a couple transactions that i conducted
and my homeboy just might snitch under pressure so motherfuck him
it's just me and my two nuts and you can bet they gon' hang
and bitch my résumé gon' check out 'til i check out the game
sometimes that ski mask on my skull it took effect on my brain
and i still live to tell this shit i'm sick of tellin you mayne
somebody talk to 'em


somebody talk to me
somebody better explain how my name's endin up in your mouth
somebody talk to me
you got two seconds to talk i want some answers right the fuck now
somebody talk to me

somebody talk to me
we're almost past the point of bein able to talk this shit out
somebody better explain
why my ears are ringin so loud
if someone's got somethin to say
grow some balls and say it to my face~
you know growin up in the hood
you go through all kind of thangs ya heard
some of it's good some of it's bad
but the thangs you go through in life make you who you are
look at me now


and from the day i was born i've been hustlin strong
  i've been strugglin since a child now them days is gone
and niggaz said i wouldn't do it now i'm provin 'em wrong
  and now they got their hands out like i owe them some
i ain't got time for the bickerin and carryin on
  it ain't too much in the hood i don't know
how many times do i have to say that i'm grown
  that i'ma young buck and still enough to know when you niggaz is hoes


i still remember them nights under the street light
fiends don't give a damn they want who got the cheap price 
i'm tryin to get right get it in dough
you see people is dyin fast and the money is slow
we used to hang in front of the sto' flag down cars
to be a movie star go get a glass jar 
once you cook it and cut it homey go stand out in public
see the work sell itself if you got enough of it 
plenty thugs been shot but see it's all in the game
even i took a couple of 'em but still i remain
i ain't different from that same lil' project figure
i done went with no lights and no water nigga
and i'm still hood that mean i still could
get on the block and get mine like you should 
how can i be good when rappers wanna be suge
surroundin myself with family so i can sleep good




i would light me a cancer stick thinkin how can i get
my momma out the bricks and my whole clique legit
lil' jimmy and the feds it's just me and some teds
we cuttin heads doin whatever to buy a loaf of bread 
the high speed chases i really loved it
to blow 50 g's and don't thank nothin of it
we showed love but wasn't no love showed back
whoa kemosabe  what part of the game is that
it's a fact and my war wounds on me can prove it
but look how you made me go and show you i can do it 
i solemnly swear to hold it down for my homeboys 
locked up and don't know if they ever comin home boy
time keeps tickin another baby's born
that's gon' go through the same stuff that i went through and more
you wonder why i hustle my life's on the line
my baby gotta have milk when she crying c'mon now




now everybody got they hand out 
crackhead willie spent his millions 'til they ranned out
shorty don't wanna holla now because her man out
but just last week i couldn't get it out her damn mouth 
nowhere to go look like i'm stuck in these bricks
seem like the good die young the bad get rich quick enough of this
let me take it to a whole 'nother level 
like stoppin the po lice from rollin through the ghetto 
ain't nuttin gettin better but the bills gotta be paid
and money come up short then them tecs gotta get sprayed 
e'rybody got a grave we just waitin to go to it
no matter what we do y'all we're still gon' go through it
some say that i'm heartless and don't give a damn
but they will never understand until they get a gram
and this is who i am not who i wanna be
open up yo' eyes and see what these streets done done to me
